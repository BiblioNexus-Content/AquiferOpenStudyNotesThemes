    "content": "<p>God wanted people to worship where he had chosen to put his name. For Israel, this was first the tabernacle and later the temple in Jerusalem.</p><p>God is <em>transcendent </em>(above all things) and <em>omnipresent </em>(present everywhere). Yet he chose a specific place for Israel to worship him. King Solomon later asked how the God of heaven could live in a building made by humans (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:27\">1 Kings 8:27</a>). The answer is that God&apos;s name represents himself.</p><p>The tabernacle and later the temple belonged to him and his name marked them. So they were, in a way, his homes. In the ancient Near East, names were more than just labels. They showed the character and nature of the person (for example, Jacob, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen27:36\">Genesis 27:36</a>; Jesus, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt1:21\">Matthew 1:21</a>; Barnabas, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts4:36\">Acts 4:36</a>; Peter, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt16:17-Matt16:19\">Matthew 16:17–19</a>). Thus, Solomon could advise, “<span>A good name is more desirable than great riches</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov22:1\">Proverbs 22:1</a>).</p><p>God lived in a holy place that carried his name. His glorious presence appeared as fire and cloud during the time Israel lived in the wilderness. This acted as a constant reminder that he was with his people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod40:34-Exod40:35\">Exodus 40:34–35</a>). Similarly, when Solomon established the temple, God&apos;s presence was also evident (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:10-1Kgs8:11\">1 Kings 8:10–11</a>).</p><p>God later lived among his people as Jesus Christ (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:14\">John 1:14</a>). This removed the need for a central holy place (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John4:19-John4:24\">John 4:19–24</a>). Now, because the Holy Spirit lives within them, all Christians can &quot;house&quot; God&apos;s presence (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor3:16-1Cor3:17\">1 Corinthians 3:16–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:19-1Cor6:20\">6:19–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor6:16\">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph2:21\">Ephesians 2:21</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod25:8-Exod25:9\">Exodus 25:8–9</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod25:22\">22</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod25:40\">40</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod26:30\">26:30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod33:7-Exod33:11\">33:7–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod40:34-Exod40:35\">40:34–35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num7:1\">Numbers 7:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num11:16\">11:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut12:4-Deut12:7\">Deuteronomy 12:4–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut31:14-Deut31:15\">31:14–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:10-1Kgs8:11\">1 Kings 8:10–11</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:27\">27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:14\">John 1:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John2:19-John2:21\">2:19–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts7:44\">Acts 7:44</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor3:16-1Cor3:17\">1 Corinthians 3:16–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:19-1Cor6:20\">6:19–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor6:16\">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph2:21\">Ephesians 2:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb8:2\">Hebrews 8:2</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb8:5\">5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:22\">Revelation 21:22</a></p>",
