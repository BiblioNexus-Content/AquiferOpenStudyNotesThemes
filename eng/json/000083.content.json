    "content": "<p>The word &quot;covenant&quot; (from the Hebrew word <em>berith</em>) means &quot;bond.&quot; A covenant is a binding relationship based on a commitment that includes promises and duties. The covenant relationship requires faithfulness and enables peace and harmony.</p><p>Covenants can be between:</p><ul><li><p>individuals (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen21:27\">Genesis 21:27</a>)</p></li><li><p>entire nations (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh9:15-Josh9:18\">Joshua 9:15–18</a>)</p></li><li><p>God and humans</p></li></ul><p>The covenant theme in the Old Testament starts with the patriarch Noah. Through Noah, God made a promise to all creation. God promised he would keep taking care of the world he created. He gave the rainbow as a sign to show he would keep this promise (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen9:1-Gen9:17\">Genesis 9:1–17</a>).</p><p>God later made a covenant with the patriarch Abraham and his family. The sign of this covenant was circumcision (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:9\">Genesis 12:1–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen15:1-Gen15:21\">15:1–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:9-Gen17:14\">17:9–14</a>). (Circumcision is the process of removing the foreskin of the male reproductive organ.) God&apos;s covenant with Abraham promised descendants, land, rulers, and blessings for all nations. These promises became the basis for future covenants God made with his people.</p><p>God&apos;s covenant with the people of Israel at Mount Sinai was a national agreement. The sign of this covenant was the Sabbath day, a weekly day of rest (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod19:1-Exod24:18\">Exodus 19–24</a>). It explained how Israel would be God&apos;s chosen people. This covenant was like a suzerain-vassal treaty. This was an ancient agreement between a powerful king (called a suzerain) and loyal subjects (called a vassal; see <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"10305\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleStudyNotes\">study note on Exodus 20:1–23:33</span>).</p><p>God renewed the covenant at Mount Sinai in the book of Deuteronomy and in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh24:1-Josh24:28\">Joshua 24:1–28</a>. The renewed covenant emphasized God&apos;s promise of land and how Israel should behave while living there. Through this covenant, God confirmed that he was their God and they were his people. This meant he required their complete loyalty (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer11:4\">Jeremiah 11:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer24:7\">24:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek11:20\">Ezekiel 11:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek14:11\">14:11</a>). God, as the great king (the suzerain), would bless and protect the nation of Israel (the vassal). Israel&apos;s duty was to be loyal to God&apos;s commands, decrees, and regulations (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod19:5\">Exodus 19:5</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod19:8\">8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod24:3\">24:3</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod24:7\">7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut30:15-Deut30:20\">Deuteronomy 30:15–20</a>).</p><p>God later made a covenant with King David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam7:5-2Sam7:16\">2 Samuel 7:5–16</a>). This covenant related to the family line of kings promised to Abraham and Jacob (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:6\">Genesis 17:6</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:16\">16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen35:11\">35:11</a>).</p><p>Years later, during a difficult time in Israel&apos;s history, the prophet Jeremiah spoke of a &quot;new covenant&quot; for Israel in the future (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:33\">Jeremiah 31:31–33</a>). This covenant would finally fulfill the promises of the covenants with Abraham and Israel. Jeremiah&apos;s prophecy came true through the life and work of Jesus Christ (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke22:20\">Luke 22:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb8:6-Heb8:13\">Hebrews 8:6–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb12:24\">12:24</a>). This new covenant fully realized the earlier promises made to God&apos;s people.</p><p>God made these covenants because of his faithful love (from the Hebrew word <em>khesed</em>). This love made it possible for God and his people to keep having a close relationship with each other. God started this relationship, set its terms, and rewarded his people if they obeyed. These covenants were divine gifts, not rewards. God might exclude people from the covenant (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos1:9\">Hosea 1:9</a>). But he will not violate or cancel his covenants. </p><p>If humans failed to keep their part of the covenant or rejected it completely, God&apos;s faithful love is the only thing that can renew it (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod34:6-Exod34:9\">Exodus 34:6–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:33\">Jeremiah 31:31–33</a>). While God&apos;s love maintains the relationship, his people must not mock his grace (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa54:7-Isa54:10\">Isaiah 54:7–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa55:3\">55:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa61:8\">61:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:9-1Cor6:10\">1 Corinthians 6:9–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal6:7\">Galatians 6:7</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen9:1-Gen9:17\">Genesis 9:1–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:9\">12:1–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen15:1-Gen15:21\">15:1–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:9-Gen17:14\">17:9–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod6:2-Exod6:5\">Exodus 6:2–5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod19:1-Exod24:18\">19:1–24:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev26:1-Lev26:46\">Leviticus 26:1–46</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut7:7-Deut7:15\">Deuteronomy 7:7–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut29:2-Deut29:29\">29:2–29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh8:30-Josh8:35\">Joshua 8:30–35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh24:1-Josh24:8\">24:1–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam7:5-2Sam7:16\">2 Samuel 7:5–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra10:1-Ezra10:17\">Ezra 10:1–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa59:20-Isa59:21\">Isaiah 59:20–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:34\">Jeremiah 31:31–34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer33:19-Jer33:26\">33:19–26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer34:12-Jer34:20\">34:12–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek16:1-Ezek16:63\">Ezekiel 16:1–63</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke22:20\">Luke 22:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal4:21-Gal4:31\">Galatians 4:21–31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph2:11-Eph2:13\">Ephesians 2:11–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb8:6-Heb8:13\">Hebrews 8:6–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb10:11-Heb10:18\">10:11–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb12:24\">12:24</a></p>",
