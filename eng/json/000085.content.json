    "content": "<p>In ancient Israel, God&apos;s glory was especially visible at the main holy places built for him. When the Israelites finished building the Tent of Meeting, &quot;the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod40:34-Exod40:35\">Exodus 40:34–35</a>). In a similar way, after they completed the temple and brought in the ark of the covenant, &quot;<span>the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD&quot;</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:10-1Kgs8:11\">1 Kings 8:10–11</a>).</p><p>The presence and absence of God&apos;s glory is a key theme in the book of Ezekiel. God&apos;s glory appears to the prophet Ezekiel while he is in exile in Babylon. This means God&apos;s glory was no longer at the temple in Jerusalem. Ezekiel&apos;s vision in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek8:1-Ezek11:25\">Ezekiel 8–11</a> explains why God&apos;s glory left the temple. The prophet sees the terrible acts that had spiritually polluted the temple. Without God&apos;s presence, the temple became an empty framework, waiting for destruction. </p><p>God did not leave the temple because the Babylonian army forced him out. He left because of his people&apos;s spiritual pollution. Their sin made him leave the land promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For a time, the Lord moved from Jerusalem to Babylon to be a holy place for the exiles there (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek11:16\">11:16</a>).</p><p>God would not leave his temple forever. After fully punishing the people, he would bring a small group back to their land and make them holy by his Spirit. This would allow him to live among them in a new holy place (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek37:26\">Ezekiel 37:26</a>). The idea of God&apos;s glory living among his people forever is central to Ezekiel&apos;s vision of their restoration (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek43:1-Ezek43:5\">43:1–5</a>).</p><p>The glory of God lives among his people fully through Jesus Christ. The apostle John says, “<span>We have seen His glory, the glory of the one and only Son from the Father</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:14\">John 1:14</a>). The elderly Simeon saw baby Jesus in the temple and called him “<span>a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to Your people Israel</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke2:32\">Luke 2:32</a>). While Jesus lived on earth, his glory was hidden from view. However, something special happened on a mountain called the Mount of Transfiguration. There, for a brief time, Jesus let his closest disciples see his true heavenly brightness and glory (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt17:2\">Matthew 17:2</a>). </p><p>When dying on the cross, Jesus carried the curse for our sins. In his human nature, Jesus felt abandoned by God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:46\">Matthew 27:46</a>). But now, Jesus has been given the highest honor and power. God has given him the most important place next to himself, &quot;<span>seated… at His right hand&quot; (</span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph1:19-Eph1:20\">Ephesians 1:19–20</a>). Through the Holy Spirit, he promises to remain with us until the end of time (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt28:20\">Matthew 28:20</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod15:11\">Exodus 15:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod33:18-Exod34:8\">33:18–34:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod40:34\">40:34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps19:1-Ps19:11\">Psalm 19:1–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa4:5-Isa4:6\">Isaiah 4:5–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa6:3\">6:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa40:5\">40:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa42:8\">42:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa43:7\">43:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa58:8\">58:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa60:1-Isa60:2\">60:1–2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek1:1-Ezek1:28\">Ezekiel 1:1–28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek11:16\">11:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek37:26\">37:26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek43:1-Ezek43:5\">43:1–5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek44:4\">44:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hab2:14\">Habakkuk 2:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt17:2\">Matthew 17:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt28:20\">28:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke2:32\">Luke 2:32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:14\">John 1:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor4:4-2Cor4:6\">2 Corinthians 4:4–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:3\">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:10-Rev21:11\">Revelation 21:10–11</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:23\">23</a></p>",
