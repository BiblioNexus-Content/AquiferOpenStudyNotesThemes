    "content": "<p>A covenant is a special agreement or promise between two groups or individuals. In the Bible, covenants are often made between God and humans. These agreements typically include promises, obligations, and sometimes signs or symbols to remember the covenant. The first clear mention of a covenant in Scripture appears right after the great flood (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen9:1-Gen9:17\">Genesis 9:1–17</a>). </p><p>God saw that humans had become very wicked and were doing evil things. This grieved God, and God regretted making humans on the earth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen6:5-Gen6:7\">Genesis 6:5–7</a>). God punished humans because of their corruption and violence (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen6:11-Gen6:13\">Genesis 6:11–13</a>). But God still showed kindness to Noah (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen6:8\">6:8</a>). God told Noah to build an ark (a large boat) to survive the coming flood (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen6:13-Gen6:17\">6:13–17</a>). Although humanity was unfaithful, God promised to make a covenant with Noah, his family, and all creation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen6:1-Gen6:7\">6:1–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen9:8-Gen9:13\">9:8–13</a>). </p><p>God guaranteed a relationship with Noah&apos;s family, even as other relationships between God and humans ended (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen6:18\">Genesis 6:18</a>). God&apos;s promise to Noah included the command to build an ark (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen6:14\">6:14</a>). For Noah to receive the blessing from the covenant, he had to obey this command (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen6:22\">6:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen7:5\">7:5</a>).</p><p>After the great flood, Noah made an offering to God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen8:20-Gen8:22\">Genesis 8:20–22</a>). God then explained his covenant with Noah. This covenant was universal, including humans and all living creatures (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen9:8-Gen9:10\">9:8–10</a>). God promised never to send another flood as a judgment on the world (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen9:15\">9:15</a>).</p><p>This covenant helps us understand what God&apos;s covenants mean. Even though people deserve punishment for their wickedness, God withholds complete destruction. God&apos;s covenant with Noah did not establish a close relationship between God and every living being. Instead, it remade moral and earthly life as God intended (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen9:1-Gen9:7\">Genesis 9:1–7</a>). This allowed for a more intimate covenant in the future (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen17:1-Gen17:21\">17:1–21</a>). Although they do what is wrong, people can live in God&apos;s world and seek a deeper relationship with the Creator during their lives. God&apos;s later covenants made a close relationship with him available to everyone (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts2:22-Acts2:40\">Acts 2:22–40</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts3:17-Acts3:26\">3:17–26</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen9:1-Gen9:17\">Genesis 9:1–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek14:12-Ezek14:23\">Ezekiel 14:12–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt24:37-Matt24:39\">Matthew 24:37–39</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:7\">Hebrews 11:7</a></p>",
