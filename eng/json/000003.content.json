    "content": "<p>In the Gospel of John, Jesus often uses the phrase &quot;I am&quot; (in Greek, the phrase is <em>egō eimi</em>). Sometimes, Jesus uses this phrase to describe himself. For example, Jesus said, &quot;I am the bread of life.&quot; The Gospel of John contains seven statements where Jesus says &quot;I am&quot; followed by a description of himself (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John6:35\">John 6:35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John8:12\">8:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John10:9\">10:9</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John10:11\">11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:25\">11:25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John14:6\">14:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John15:1\">15:1</a>). </p><p>It is important to note that Greek does not need the pronoun &quot;I&quot; (<em>egō</em>) in these sentences. Therefore, using the pronoun emphasizes the speaker&apos;s identity. Another example is in the sermon on the mount in the Gospel of Matthew. Jesus says, &quot;You have heard that it was said … but <em>I</em> [<em>egō</em>] tell you&quot; (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:22\">Matthew 5:22</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:28\">28</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:32\">32</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:34\">34</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:39\">39</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:44\">44</a>, and other passages). Including the personal pronoun emphasizes the difference between Jesus&apos; teachings and those of Moses. This phrase emphasizes the unique authority of Jesus.</p><p>Sometimes, Jesus used the phrase &quot;I am&quot; in a grammatically unusual way, without anything following it. For example, Jesus said, &quot;Before Abraham was even born, I am&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John8:58\">John 8:58</a>). <em>Before Abraham, Jesus was what?</em> (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John8:28\">8:28</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John8:59\">59</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John13:19\">13:19</a>). </p><p>The best explanation for this odd expression comes from the Old Testament. When Moses met the Lord on Mount Sinai, he wanted to know God&apos;s name (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:6\">Exodus 3:6</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:13-Exod3:14\">13–14</a>). God told him that his name is &quot;YHWH,&quot; four Hebrew letters that can express existence. </p><p>When the Jews translated the Old Testament into Greek, in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:14\">Exodus 3:14</a> God’s name “I AM WHO I AM” became egō eimi ho ōn (“I am the one who is”). In other places, especially in Isaiah <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa43:25\">Isaiah 43:25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa51:12\">51:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa52:6\">52:6</a>), the Greek Old Testament uses egō eimi (“I am”) as a special way God speaks about himself. In many other verses, the Greek translation uses kurios (“Lord”) for God’s name. Some Jews understood Jesus’s words “I am” as a claim to God’s name, as in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John8:58\">John 8:58</a>, where they tried to stone him. But in other places, like <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John8:24\">John 8:24</a>, they did not react that way and only asked him, “Who are you?”</p><p>Jesus not only represents God. The “I Am” statements show Jesus’ divine nature, indicating he can work, speak, and act in place of the Father. He is not just a human. He is the Word<em> </em>of God who became human (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:1\">John 1:1</a>). His voice is the Father&apos;s voice, and his life reveals God&apos;s life in a human body. The phrase “I Am” powerfully expresses who Jesus is.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John6:35\">John 6:35</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John6:48\">48</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John8:12\">8:12</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John8:58\">58</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John9:5\">9:5; </a><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John10:7-John10:14\">10:7–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:25\">11:25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John14:6\">14:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John15:1\">15:1</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John15:5\">5</a></p>",
