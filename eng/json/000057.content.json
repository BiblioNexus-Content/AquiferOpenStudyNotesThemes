    "content": "<p>When Jesus was about to suffer and die, he told his followers they would also experience great difficulties (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt24:9\">Matthew 24:9</a>). He emphasized the importance of endurance: “The one who perseveres to the end will be saved” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt24:13\">Matthew 24:13</a>). Many New Testament writings were for Christians suffering for their faith in Christ (see, for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess1:4\">2 Thessalonians 1:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet4:12-1Pet4:19\">1 Peter 4:12–19</a>). These Christians needed encouragement to persevere through difficulty while remaining committed to Christ and sharing their faith with others (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:5\">2 Timothy 4:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet4:1\">1 Peter 4:1</a>). Through endurance, Christians grow in character and develop spiritual maturity (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom5:3-Rom5:4\">Romans 5:3–4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas1:2-Jas1:4\">James 1:2–4</a>).</p><p>The book of Hebrews spoke to Christians who had encountered many challenges. People harassed them, took their property, and imprisoned them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb10:32-Heb10:34\">Hebrews 10:32–34</a>). </p><p>At the time of writing, they had similar issues. They needed to &quot;hold firmly&quot; to their beliefs without wavering (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb4:14\">4:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb10:23\">10:23</a>). They must endure while waiting for God&apos;s promises to come true (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb6:12\">6:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb10:36\">10:36</a>). Like runners in a race, they needed to &quot;<span>run with endurance the race set out for&quot; them </span>(<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb12:1\">12:1</a>). As true children of a loving father, they were to accept the Lord&apos;s discipline to grow in holiness (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb12:5-Heb12:13\">12:5–13</a>).</p><p>The great examples of endurance in Scripture, such as Job and the prophets, can inspire all Christians (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:35-Heb11:40\">Hebrews 11:35–40</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas5:10-Jas5:11\">James 5:10–11</a>). Christ, our main model of endurance, &quot;endured the cross,&quot; because of &quot;<span>the joy set before Him</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb12:1-Heb12:3\">12:1–3</a>). This same hope for the future inspires us to endure.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom5:3-Rom5:4\">Romans 5:3–4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor4:12\">1 Corinthians 4:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess1:4\">2 Thessalonians 1:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb6:12\">Hebrews 6:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb12:1-Heb12:10\">Hebrews 12:1–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas1:2-Jas1:4\">James 1:2–4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas5:11\">James 5:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet2:20\">1 Peter 2:20</a></p>",
