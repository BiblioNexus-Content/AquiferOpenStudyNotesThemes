    "content": "<p>God has authority and control over all creation. But he wants people to share their concerns with him through prayer. The Bible shows examples of God responding to people&apos;s prayers. Prayer is important for living a godly life and effective Christian service. It helps people submit their will to God.</p><p>The short book of Nehemiah tells the story of a man devoted to prayer. When he saw Jerusalem&apos;s poor condition, Nehemiah prayed intensely for four months (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh1:1\">Nehemiah 1:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh2:1\">2:1</a>). His prayers praised God for his power and love. Nehemiah confessed the nation&apos;s sins and asked God to help (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh1:4-Neh1:11\">1:4–11</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra9:6-Ezra9:15\">Ezra 9:6–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan9:4-Dan9:19\">Daniel 9:4–19</a>). Nehemiah&apos;s based his prayer for Jerusalem on God&apos;s &quot;<span>covenant of loving devotion with those who love Him and keep His commandments&quot; </span>(<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh1:5\">1:5</a>). </p><p>The Israelites had not followed the instructions God gave to Moses (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh1:7\">1:7</a>). As God had warned, this disobedience resulted in their exile. Yet, Nehemiah firmly believed that God would restore the nation if the people repented (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh1:8-Neh1:9\">1:8–9</a>; see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut4:25-Deut4:31\">Deuteronomy 4:25–31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut30:1-Deut30:5\">30:1–5</a>).</p><p>God gave Nehemiah a chance to speak to the Persian king about returning to Jerusalem. Nehemiah prayed for guidance (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh2:4\">Nehemiah 2:4</a>). He understood that only God could change the king&apos;s will. Later, Nehemiah responded to threats against the builders of Jerusalem&apos;s wall by posting guards and encouraging the people. Yet, he also prayed for protection and strength (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh4:4-Neh4:5\">Nehemiah 4:4–5</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh4:9\">9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh6:9\">6:9</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh6:14\">14</a>). He needed God&apos;s help and blessing both then and in the future as he dealt with those who behaved wrongly.</p><p>Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem after a short visit to Persia. He learned that some Jews were not giving their tithe (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh13:10-Neh13:12\">Nehemiah 13:10–12</a>). Some were not observing the Sabbath (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh13:15-Neh13:16\">13:15–16</a>). Some had married non-Jews (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh13:23-Neh13:24\">13:23–24</a>). When he confronted them about their actions, Nehemiah prayed for God to show him compassion and remember his efforts (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh13:14\">13:14</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh13:22\">22</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh13:31\">31</a>). Nehemiah understood that only God&apos;s power could change people.</p><p>Jesus knew well the Father&apos;s will, yet his ministry had its basis in prayer (see, for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke5:16\">Luke 5:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke6:12-Luke6:16\">6:12–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke9:18\">9:18</a>). Following his example, early Christians prayed often, believing firmly in its power (see, for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts9:36-Acts9:41\">9:36–41</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts12:3-Acts12:11\">12:3–11</a>). God often responds powerfully to prayers. God wants Christians to pray with confidence, expecting him to answer (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas5:16-Jas5:18\">James 5:16–18</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen24:10-Gen24:20\">Genesis 24:10–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg15:18-Judg15:20\">Judges 15:18–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra9:6-Ezra9:15\">Ezra 9:6–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh1:4-Neh1:11\">Nehemiah 1:4–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh2:4-Neh2:5\">2:4–5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh4:4-Neh4:5\">4:4–5</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh4:9\">9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps18:1-Ps18:30\">Psalms 18:1–30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps22:4-Ps22:5\">22:4–5</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps22:24\">24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps30:2-Ps30:3\">30:2–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps31:22\">31:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps34:4\">34:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps40:1-Ps40:2\">40:1–2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps81:7\">81:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps106:1-Ps106:48\">106:1–48</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps107:6-Ps107:7\">107:6–7</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps107:13-Ps107:14\">13–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps116:1\">116:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps118:5\">118:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan9:4-Dan9:19\">Daniel 9:4–19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jonah2:1-Jonah2:10\">Jonah 2:1–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts4:24-Acts4:31\">Acts 4:24–31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas5:16-Jas5:18\">James 5:16–18</a></p>",
