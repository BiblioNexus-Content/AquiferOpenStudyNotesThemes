    "content": "<p>Jesus&apos; miracles and parables (symbolic stories with a special meaning) often take away the focus on his encounters with people that changed their lives. In these encounters, Jesus deals with individuals as they are. He invites people from all backgrounds to accept him as a leader and friend. He invites them to become his followers and messengers of his eternal kingdom. </p><p>Yet, following Jesus requires a choice. The world&apos;s power and wealth can be too distracting to transfer into kingdom service. Following Jesus means leaving something behind. Those who hold on to worldly things often end up rejecting Jesus. This choice challenges everyone who encounters Jesus in the Gospels and hears his call to follow.</p><p>Andrew was a fisherman in Galilee. He hoped for the Messiah (God&apos;s chosen one) and his kingdom to come. He followed John the Baptist until John showed him Jesus. Then Andrew followed Jesus and invited others, including his brother Peter, to join him. <em>See </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:29-John1:42\"><em>John 1:29–42</em></a>.</p><p>Simeon and Anna had waited a long time to see the promised Christ. When they saw the infant Jesus, they recognized him as the Christ. They blessed and thanked God for his arrival and the hope he brought. <em>See </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke2:25-Luke2:38\"><em>Luke 2:25–38</em></a>.</p><p>Nathanael was doubtful when first invited to meet Jesus. Yet, when Jesus demonstrated that he already knew him, Nathanael&apos;s attitude changed. He then followed Jesus without hesitating. <em>See </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:43-John1:51\"><em>John 1:43–51</em></a>.</p><p>A wealthy man approached Jesus and asked how to gain eternal life. This man showed humility and had already carefully followed all of God&apos;s laws. &quot;Jesus loved him&quot; but said he needed to sell all his possessions, give to the poor, and follow him. The man was unwilling to give up his wealth and sadly walked away from Jesus. <em>See </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:17-Mark10:22\"><em>Mark 10:17–22</em></a>.</p><p>Matthew abandoned his Jewish heritage, betrayed his people by collecting Roman taxes, and chose a life of wealth and luxury. When Jesus called Matthew to follow him, Matthew left his old life. Before traveling with Jesus, Matthew invited his friends to meet him. <em>See </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt9:9-Matt9:13\"><em>Matthew 9:9–13</em></a>.</p><p>Thomas did not believe the other disciples when they said Jesus had come back to life. When Jesus appeared to Thomas, he invited Thomas to touch his wounds. Thomas then bowed before Jesus and declared his belief that Jesus was his Lord and God. <em>See </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John20:19-John20:29\"><em>John 20:19–29</em></a>.</p><p>Martha was busy preparing a meal for Jesus at her home. She became upset because her sister Mary was sitting and learning at Jesus’ feet. Jesus gently encouraged Martha not to be angry and explained that Mary had made the better choice by listening to his teaching. Later, Jesus spoke with Martha to affirm her faith in him for eternal life. <em>See </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke10:38-Luke10:42\"><em>Luke 10:38–42</em></a><em>; </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:17-John11:27\"><em>John 11:17–27</em></a>.</p><p>A Roman officer asked Jesus to save his dying slave. He excused Jesus from visiting his ceremonially unclean home since he was a gentile and not a Jew. This was because the officer believed Jesus could heal by simply speaking. Jesus honored the officer&apos;s faith by healing the slave from a distance. Jesus also affirmed that many gentiles would enter the kingdom of heaven through trust in him. <em>See </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt8:5-Matt8:13\"><em>Matthew 8:5–13</em></a>.</p><p>Jewish leaders brought a woman accused of adultery to Jesus so he would judge her. Stoning was the expected punishment. Jesus wrote in the dust and asked any accuser without sin to throw the first stone. When they all left, Jesus told the woman to leave and stop sinning. <em>See </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John8:1-John8:11\"><em>John 8:1–11</em></a>.</p><p>Nicodemus was a Jewish religious leader and Pharisee. So he was careful about people seeing him with Jesus. So Nicodemus visited him at night. Jesus spoke with Nicodemus and challenged his beliefs about spiritual truth. Nicodemus later defended Jesus at the Jewish council (Sanhedrin). After Jesus&apos; crucifixion, Nicodemus helped bury Jesus, showing his commitment. <em>See </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John3:1-John3:21\"><em>John 3:1–21</em></a><em>; </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John7:50-John7:52\"><em>7:50–52</em></a><em>; </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John19:38-John19:42\"><em>19:38–42</em></a>.</p><p>James and John thought God&apos;s kingdom was near, so they asked for places of honor. This request upset the other disciples. Jesus kindly explained that true leadership is a matter of service, not wealth or power. The disciples would learn this lesson through difficult experiences. <em>See </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:35-Mark10:45\"><em>Mark 10:35–45</em></a><em>; </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John13:1-John13:17\"><em>John 13:1–17</em></a>.</p><p>The people of Nazareth only knew Jesus as Joseph’s son. They did not believe he could be the Christ. Their doubt greatly limited Jesus’ miracles among them. Their anger at his claims gave him reason to leave. <em>See </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke4:14-Luke4:30\"><em>Luke 4:14–30</em></a>.</p><p>The religious leaders followed detailed laws focused on outward behavior. But they did not show love in more important ways. Jesus repeatedly challenged them about this. But most leaders rejected his criticism and sought ways to harm him. <em>See </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke11:37-Luke11:54\"><em>Luke 11:37–54</em></a><em>; compare </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts6:8-Acts8:1\"><em>Acts 6:8–8:1</em></a><em>; </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts9:1-Acts9:31\"><em>9:1–31</em></a>.</p><p>Zacchaeus collected taxes for Rome and became rich by taking advantage of his people. He wanted to see Jesus, so he climbed a tree to look over the crowd. Jesus noticed him, visited his house, and invited Zacchaeus to change his life. Zacchaeus repented and repaid everyone he had wronged. <em>See </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke19:1-Luke19:10\"><em>Luke 19:1–10</em></a>.</p><p>Two followers of Jesus were returning home to Emmaus after Jesus&apos; death. Along the way, the resurrected Jesus joined them and explained from Scripture why he had died. They did not recognize Jesus until he had meal with them. Then Jesus disappeared. The two joyfully left to tell the disciples that Jesus was alive. <em>See </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:13-Luke24:35\"><em>Luke 24:13–35</em></a>.</p><p>A Samaritan woman with a bad reputation went to Jacob&apos;s well to get water and found Jesus there. Jesus offered her &quot;living water&quot; and a new life. This surprised her but she believed him. Then she invited others to meet the Christ for which they had been waiting. <em>See </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John4:1-John4:42\"><em>John 4:1–42</em></a>.</p><p>The Jewish leaders pressured Pilate to kill Jesus. Pilate believed Jesus was innocent and tried to release him. Pilate asked Jesus, “What is truth?” But he did not understand that Jesus was was the Truth. In the end, to maintain peace with the Jewish leaders, Pilate gave the order to crucify Jesus. <em>See </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John18:28-John19:16\"><em>John 18:28–19:16</em></a>.</p><p>Simon Peter denied knowing Jesus three times. After Jesus rose from the dead, he asked Peter three times if he loved him. Each time, Peter said he loved him. Jesus instructed him to care for his followers (his &quot;sheep&quot; and &quot;lambs&quot;). In this way, Jesus restored Peter to the Christian faith. <em>See </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John21:1-John21:23\"><em>John 21:1–23</em></a><em>; see also </em><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt16:15-Matt16:19\"><em>Matthew 16:15–19</em></a>.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt8:5-Matt8:13\">Matthew 8:5–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt9:9-Matt9:13\">9:9–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt16:15-Matt16:19\">16:15–19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:17-Mark10:22\">Mark 10:17–22</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:35-Mark10:45\">35–45</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke2:25-Luke2:38\">Luke 2:25–38</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke4:14-Luke4:30\">4:14–30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke10:38-Luke10:42\">10:38–42</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke11:37-Luke11:54\">11:37–54</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke19:1-Luke19:10\">19:1–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:13-Luke24:35\">24:13–35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:29-John1:42\">John 1:29–42</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:43-John1:51\">43–51</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John3:1-John3:21\">3:1–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John4:1-John4:42\">4:1–42</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John7:50-John7:52\">7:50–52</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John8:1-John8:11\">8:1–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John11:17-John11:27\">11:17–27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John13:1-John13:17\">13:1–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John18:28-John19:16\">18:28–19:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John19:38-John19:42\">19:38–42</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John20:19-John20:29\">20:19–29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John21:1-John21:23\">21:1–23</a></p>",
