    "content": "<p>Scripture often describes angels as beings that inspire awe or fear (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh5:13-Josh5:15\">Joshua 5:13–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke2:8-Luke2:10\">Luke 2:8–10</a>). Yet, angels serve God and he does not allow people to worship them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:5-Heb1:14\">Hebrews 1:5–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev19:10\">Revelation 19:10</a>). Jewish tradition developed the idea of angels as mediators (those who connect others to God). In pre-Christian Judaism, people emphasized God&apos;s <em>transcendence</em> or &quot;otherness&quot; so much that they believed mediators were necessary to communicate with him. In this context, angels became more important.</p><p>For Christians, Jesus has a unique role as mediator between God and humans.  Focusing on angels or deceased saints as ways to communicate with God can distract from honoring Jesus as the only necessary mediator (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim2:5-1Tim2:6\">1 Timothy 2:5–6</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor5:19-2Cor5:21\">2 Corinthians 5:19–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:24-Heb7:25\">Hebrews 7:24–25</a>). God still uses angelic messengers, but they are creatures serving him, not divine beings to worship. Only God deserves our prayers and worship.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts27:23-Acts27:24\">Acts 27:23–24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor5:19-2Cor5:21\">2 Corinthians 5:19–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim2:5-1Tim2:6\">1 Timothy 2:5–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:5-Heb1:14\">Hebrews 1:5–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:24-Heb7:25\">7:24–25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev19:10\">Revelation 19:10</a></p>",
