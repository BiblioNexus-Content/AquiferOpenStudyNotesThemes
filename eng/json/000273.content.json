    "content": "<p>The book of Hebrews shows why Jesus, the Son of God, is greater than all others in who he is (his nature) and what he does (his ministry).</p><h2>Superior in Nature</h2><p>The Son&apos;s superior <em>nature</em> is mainly discussed in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:1-Heb3:6\">Hebrews 1:1–3:6</a>. In the book&apos;s introduction (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:1-Heb1:4\">1:1–4</a>), the Son is shown as the creator, supporter, and heir of the universe (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:2-Heb1:3\">1:2–3</a>). He is &quot;<span>the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of His nature</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:3\">1:3</a>). He is honored, having cleansed sins and has a status &quot;<span>far superior to the angels</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:3-Heb1:4\">1:3–4</a>).</p><h2>Superior to Angels </h2><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:5-Heb1:14\">Hebrews 1:5–14</a> and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb2:5-Heb2:18\">2:5–18</a>, the Son is shown to be greater than the angels. He has a special relationship with the Father (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:5\">1:5</a>). He is the ruler, creator, and he who changer of the created world (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:8-Heb1:12\">1:8–12</a>). The angels have a lower status than him, and they worship him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:6-Heb1:7\">1:6–7</a>). God the Father raises him to the highest position of honor at his right hand (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:13\">1:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps110:1\">Psalm 110:1</a>). He has authority over everything (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb2:5-Heb2:8\">Hebrews 2:5–8</a>).</p><h2>Superior to Moses</h2><p>In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb3:1-Heb3:6\">Hebrews 3:1–6</a>, the author uses the respect his audience has for Moses to argue for even greater respect for the Son. Like Moses, the Son was faithful in serving God&apos;s people. Yet, the Son deserves more glory and praise than Moses because he has the same nature as God the Father. The Son is the ultimate builder of God&apos;s house (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb3:3-Heb3:4\">3:3–4</a>). The Son is ultimately in charge of God&apos;s people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb3:5-Heb3:6\">3:5–6</a>).</p><h2>Superior Ministry</h2><h3>Superior Priest</h3><p>The sections highlighting the Son&apos;s superior <em>ministry</em> are mainly in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:1-Heb10:18\">Hebrews 7:1–10:18</a>. Through his superior role as high priest, Jesus has introduced a &quot;better hope&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:19\">7:19</a>). &quot;A better covenant&quot; guarantees this hope (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:22\">7:22</a>). &quot;Better promises&quot; ground this hope (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb8:6\">8:6</a>). This allows him to perform a ministry &quot;more excellent&quot; than that of the old covenant priests (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb8:6\">8:6</a>). The old covenant was the agreement God made with the Israelites through Moses.</p><h3>Superior Sacrifice</h3><p>Jesus&apos; ministry under the new covenant is a better system because of his &quot;better sacrifices&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb9:10\">9:10</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb9:23\">23</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb12:24\">12:24</a>). The new covenant is the new agreement God made through Jesus. Jesus&apos; ministry leads new-covenant believers in God to expect &quot;<span>a better and permanent possession</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb10:34\">10:34</a>). It is a &quot;<span>better country, a heavenly one</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:16\">11:16</a>). They will &quot;<span>gain a better resurrection</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:35\">11:35</a>). For believers in Jesus under the new covenant, God has &quot;planned something better&quot; that old-covenant believers could only anticipate (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:40\">11:40</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps110:1\">Psalm 110:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb1:1-Heb1:14\">Hebrews 1:1–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb3:1-Heb3:6\">3:1–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:1-Heb10:18\">7:1–10:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb10:34\">10:34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:16\">11:16</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:35\">35</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:40\">40</a></p>",
