    "content": "<p>When the Israelites left Egypt and entered the wilderness, God provided manna. Manna was a substance like bread that God gave them to eat (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod16:1-Exod16:36\">Exodus 16</a>). The LORD gave them enough food for their daily needs (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh9:20-Neh9:21\">Nehemiah 9:20–21</a>). This &quot;bread from heaven&quot; demonstrated God&apos;s love and showed his special care for Israel in the wilderness (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut8:3\">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut8:16\">16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps78:24\">Psalms 78:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps105:40\">105:40</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev2:17\">Revelation 2:17</a>).</p><p>Manna was real food, but some passages use it symbolically. It represents a spiritual relationship with God. It is a sign of God&apos;s miraculous provision for his people (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor10:3-1Cor10:4\">1 Corinthians 10:3–4</a>). At the same time, manna relates to Israel&apos;s complaints against God and their lack of trust in his provision (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num11:1-Num11:15\">Numbers 11:1–15</a>; see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor10:5\">1 Corinthians 10:5</a>).</p><p>Jesus miraculously fed about 5,000 men near the Sea of Galilee, in addition to women and children. Then he taught in the synagogue at Capernaum about the “bread of life” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John6:22-John6:59\">John 6:22–59</a>). He called himself the “true bread from heaven” and “the bread of life” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John6:32-John6:35\">John 6:32–35</a>). He even connected eternal life with the need to eat &quot;My flesh and drink My blood” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John6:50-John6:58\">John 6:50–58</a>). Manna provided food in the wilderness. But Jesus is the true bread from God, who offers spiritual food and strength. Israel&apos;s need for food humbled them in the wilderness (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut8:3\">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>). Now, followers of Jesus must humble themselves and receive the fullness of his life by faith (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John6:35-John6:40\">John 6:35–40</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John6:47-John6:51\">47–51</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John6:63-John6:64\">63–64</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod16:1-Exod16:36\">Exodus 16:1–36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num11:1-Num11:15\">Numbers 11:1–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut8:3\">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut8:16\">16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh5:10-Josh5:12\">Joshua 5:10–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh9:20-Neh9:21\">Nehemiah 9:20–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps78:24\">Psalms 78:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps105:40\">105:40</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John6:1-John6:15\">John 6:1–15</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John6:22-John6:64\">22–64</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor10:3-1Cor10:5\">1 Corinthians 10:3–5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev2:17\">Revelation 2:17</a></p>",
