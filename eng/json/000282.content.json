    "content": "<p>The apostle Paul urges tolerance (patient understanding) between those weak in faith and those strong in faith. He teaches Christians to accept each other (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom14:1\">Romans 14:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom15:7\">15:7</a>). He instructs them to stop condemning one another and making each other feel unimportant. Instead, they should worship God with a united voice and spirit (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom15:6\">Romans 15:6</a>).</p><p>Paul is discussing whether Christians need to follow certain Old Testament laws and Jewish worship practices. Scholars use the Greek word <em>adiaphora</em>, meaning &quot;non-essentials,&quot; to describe beliefs or practices that Scripture neither requires nor bans. On these issues, Christians should accept different opinions. Sometimes, Christians may feel free to do certain activities, but doing so might cause problems for others. In these cases, Paul advises Christians to consider others&apos; needs before their own (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor8:1-1Cor8:13\">1 Corinthians 8:1–13</a>).</p><p>Paul uses a different approach to tolerance when the good news (gospel) is at risk. In the letter to the Galatians, for example, Paul confronts false teachings about the good news by strongly criticizing the false teachers (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal1:6-Gal1:9\">Galatians 1:6–9</a>). He warns readers that accepting false teachings will separate them from Christ (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:4\">Galatians 5:4</a>).</p><p>Today, we must be cautious about what we tolerate and what we oppose. Christians should carefully consider the issues they encounter with other Christians. If we stay true to the basic truth of the good news about Jesus, we should not argue or be divided over less important matters.</p><p>Yet, some issues affect the core message of the good news. In these cases, Christians should remain firm and faithful to the good news and to Jesus Christ. Sometimes, it is difficult to determine if an issue is central. It may be important for discussion but not essential for Christian unity. Paul&apos;s approach to various issues in his time can guide us in handling conflicts and arguments today.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps133:1-Ps133:3\">Psalm 133:1–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom12:9-Rom12:21\">Romans 12:9–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom14:1-Rom15:13\">14:1–15:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor1:10\">1 Corinthians 1:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:1-1Cor6:20\">6:1–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor8:1-1Cor8:13\">8:1–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor10:1-1Cor10:11\">10:1–11:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor12:12-1Cor12:27\">12:12–27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor13:1-1Cor13:8\">13:1–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor6:14-2Cor7:1\">2 Corinthians 6:14–7:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col3:12-Col3:15\">Colossians 3:12–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:23-2Tim2:26\">2 Timothy 2:23–26</a></p>",
