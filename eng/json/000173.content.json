    "content": "<p>In Luke’s Gospel, entering or becoming excluded from the kingdom of God involves a reversal of worldly wealth. Mary, the mother of Jesus, proclaimed that God would elevate the poor and humble while humbling the rich and powerful (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:52-Luke1:53\">Luke 1:52–53</a>). Jesus declared in Nazareth that the gospel is &quot;good news to the poor&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke4:18\">4:18</a>). He blessed the poor and hungry and warned the rich and satisfied (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke6:20-Luke6:26\">6:20–26</a>). This challenged the common belief that God blessed rich people and cursed poor people.</p><p>Several of Jesus&apos; parables strongly warn about the danger of wealth. The parable of the rich fool shows what happens when someone stores up treasures on earth instead of building a strong relationship with God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke12:13-Luke12:21\">Luke 12:13–21</a>). The parable of the rich man and Lazarus illustrates the eternal consequences of ignoring the poor and helpless while enjoying life&apos;s comforts (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke16:19-Luke16:31\">16:19–31</a>). The rich man who asked Jesus how to gain eternal life felt devastated when Jesus told him to sell all he had and give to the poor (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke18:18-Luke18:23\">18:18–23</a>).</p><p>Who are the poor in Luke’s Gospel? Are they physically poor people or those poor in spirit (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:3\">Matthew 5:3</a>)? It is probably both. The physically poor, who have very little, naturally depend on God for their needs. Rich and powerful people often rely on themselves, forgetting their need for God. Rich people cannot enter God’s kingdom if they trust in their wealth to get them there (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke16:25-Luke16:26\">16:25–26</a>). God accepts those who trust only in him.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:3\">Matthew 5:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:52-Luke1:53\">Luke 1:52–53</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke4:18\">4:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke6:20-Luke6:25\">6:20–25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke12:13-Luke12:34\">12:13–34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke14:12-Luke14:23\">14:12–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke16:19-Luke16:31\">16:19–31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke18:18-Luke18:30\">18:18–30</a></p>",
