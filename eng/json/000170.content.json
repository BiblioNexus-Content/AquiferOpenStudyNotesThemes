    "content": "<p>Many Old Testament passages suggest that the place where dead people are is a location from which people do not return (see, for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job7:6-Job7:21\">Job 7:6–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps6:5\">Psalm 6:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa38:18-Isa38:19\">Isaiah 38:18–19</a>). Yet, some passages suggest the idea of that people can live again after death (see, for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job19:25-Job19:27\">Job 19:25–27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps12:1-Ps12:3\">Psalm 16:10–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa26:19\">Isaiah 26:19</a>). <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan12:1-Dan12:3\">Daniel 12:1–3</a> teaches that God will bring the dead back to life. God told the prophet Daniel that he would be part of this resurrection (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan12:13\">12:13</a>). Belief in the resurrection of the dead became more common during the period between the Old and New Testament writings. This was shown by the popularity of the idea during the time of Jesus.</p><p>According to this passage from Daniel, the resurrection will be different for people. </p><p>Two groups will resurrect: </p><ol><li><p>Those who will experience new life.</p></li><li><p>Those who will experience shame. </p></li></ol><p>These groups have different beliefs about right and wrong, different standards for behavior, and different ways of following God. The resurrection will reveal a person&apos;s true nature. Everyone will be accountable to God Most High in a moral and spiritual way.</p><p>The first group will have a new life called &quot;everlasting life.&quot; In the Old Testament, this phrase appears only in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan12:2\">Daniel 12:2</a>. Here it seems to refer more to the quality of life than its length. God will cleanse and purify those who experience this life. The similes &quot;<span>shine like the brightness of the heavens</span>&quot; and &quot;shine like the stars forever and ever&quot; describe their moral glory. </p><p>The second group will encounter everlasting shame and disgrace because they are not morally or spiritually renewed. The New Testament book of Revelation expands on these two groups from Daniel&apos;s vision (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev20:4-Rev20:6\">Revelation 20:4–6</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev20:11-Rev20:15\">11–15</a>).</p><p>God&apos;s people will finally escape death. Those resurrected to life have their names written in the Book of Life (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan7:9-Dan7:10\">Daniel 7:9–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan10:21\">10:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev20:12\">Revelation 20:12</a>). The Judge, known as the Ancient One, declares them righteous.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job19:25-Job19:27\">Job 19:25–27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan12:1-Dan12:3\">Daniel 12:1–3</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan12:13\">13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:50-Matt27:53\">Matthew 27:50–53</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt28:1-Matt28:20\">28:1–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor15:1-1Cor15:58\">1 Corinthians 15:1–58</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev20:1-Rev20:15\">Revelation 20:1–15</a></p>",
