    "content": "<p>When people become Christians, they unite with Jesus and share in his death and resurrection. Their old life, marked by sin, ends with Jesus. They start a new life through his power within them (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom6:3-Rom6:14\">Romans 6:3–14</a>). </p><p>God transforms them by his Spirit. Their minds are renewed (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom12:2\">Romans 12:2</a>). Their desires and actions change, and their lives begin to show his Spirit (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:22-Gal5:23\">Galatians 5:22–23</a>). They begin to spiritually grow and become more like Jesus.</p><p>Christians have a duty to be &quot;conformed&quot; to Jesus&apos; death and resurrection (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil3:10-Phil3:11\">Philippians 3:10–14</a>). They must turn away from darkness and commit to a life full of light (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph4:17-Eph5:20\">Ephesians 4:17–5:20</a>). This means they are to stop living in evil ways and start living in God&apos;s good ways. The apostle Paul describes this change using the image of clothing. God calls Christians to remove the old, sinful life influenced by the devil and put on a new, pure life guided by the Holy Spirit (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph4:21-Eph4:24\">Ephesians 4:21–24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col3:1-Col3:15\">Colossians 3:1–15</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal3:27\">Galatians 3:27</a>). In doing so, they acknowledge their dependence on God’s grace and power.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom6:3-Rom6:14\">Romans 6:3–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom12:1-Rom12:2\">12:1–2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:19-Gal5:23\">Galatians 5:19–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph4:17-Eph5:20\">Ephesians 4:17–5:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil3:12-Phil3:13\">Philippians 3:12–14</a></p>",
