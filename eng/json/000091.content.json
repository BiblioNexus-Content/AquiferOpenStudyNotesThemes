    "content": "<p>The prophet Malachi begins his message to the people of Israel with, &quot;<span>I have loved you,” says the LORD</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal1:2\">Malachi 1:2</a>). God&apos;s love for Israel is clear throughout the Old Testament. Malachi tells people to look at history to see God&apos;s love and power. This connects his book to the Bible&apos;s larger story of salvation. </p><p>The writer of Psalm 78, for example, declares God&apos;s great acts to future generations, so each one might &quot;<span>put their confidence in God… keeping His commandments&quot;</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps78:2-Ps78:4\">Psalm 78:2–4</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps78:7\">7</a>). The key event in Old Testament history is the exodus from Egypt (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps78:12-Ps78:13\">Psalms 78:12–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps105:26-Ps105:38\">105:26–38</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps106:7-Ps106:12\">106:7–12</a>). This was when God freed the Israelites from slavery in Egypt and led them out of the country. Israel remembered this event every year during the Feast of Passover. They used formal instruction (catechism) to teach the next generation about God&apos;s mighty acts (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod12:1-Exod13:22\">Exodus 12–13</a>). This guaranteed they would always remember his loving actions.</p><p>Unfortunately, the people of Israel often abandoned God and broke their covenant (special agreement) with him. Even so, his love for them never fully disappeared (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos3:1\">Hosea 3:1</a>). Their rebellion resulted in God&apos;s judgment, leading finally to exile from their land. But even during this disaster, he saved a small group of his people (called a &quot;remnant&quot;) and promised to restore them to the land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa65:8-Isa65:9\">Isaiah 65:8–9</a>).</p><p>The Old Testament prophets told of a future when God would show his love for Israel by sending:</p><ul><li><p>a Branch of David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa11:1-Isa11:5\">Isaiah 11:1–5</a>);</p></li><li><p>a righteous King (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech9:9-Zech9:10\">Zechariah 9:9–10</a>); and</p></li><li><p>a Sun of righteousness (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal4:1-Mal4:3\">Malachi 4:1–3</a>).</p></li></ul><p>Jesus Christ fulfilled these prophecies. His death created another important event for God&apos;s people. Christians commemorate his death with a meal, &quot;the Lord&apos;s Supper&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor11:20-1Cor11:34\">1 Corinthians 11:20–34</a>). This act of redemption showed God&apos;s ultimate love for Jews and even non-Jews (gentiles).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod12:1-Exod13:16\">Exodus 12:1–13:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps47:4\">Psalms 47:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps78:2-Ps78:4\">78:2–4</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps78:7\">7</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps78:12-Ps78:13\">12–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps98:3\">98:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps105:26-Ps105:27\">105:26–27</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps105:37\">37</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps106:7-Ps106:8\">106:7–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos3:1\">Hosea 3:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos11:1\">11:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal1:2\">Malachi 1:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor5:7\">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor11:20-1Cor11:34\">11:20–34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor15:1-1Cor15:4\">15:1–4</a></p>",
