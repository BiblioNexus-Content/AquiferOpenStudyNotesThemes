    "content": "<p>In the final hours of his life, Jesus wanted his disciples filled with his joy (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John15:11\">John 15:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John16:20-John16:24\">16:20–24</a>). Joy is a common topic in many of the apostle Paul&apos;s letters and is a key theme in Philippians. Paul often encourages Christians to be joyful, especially those facing persecution, like the Christians in Philippi and Thessalonica (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil3:1\">Philippians 3:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil4:4\">4:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess5:16\">1 Thessalonians 5:16</a>).</p><p>Surface-level happiness depends on what is happening around you. Christian joy is different. It comes from a person&apos;s relationship with the Lord. It remains strong even during suffering and death. Joy comes from knowing that whatever happens, God will use everything for a Christian&apos;s ultimate good (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom5:3-Rom5:4\">Romans 5:3–4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:28\">8:28</a>). </p><p>Christians also find joy in the active presence of God&apos;s Spirit in their hearts (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:22\">Galatians 5:22</a>). The real secret to a joyful life is &quot;to be filled with the Holy Spirit&quot; (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph5:18\">Ephesians 5:18</a>). A relationship with the living God forms Christians&apos; attitudes, not external circumstances.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John15:11\">John 15:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John16:24\">16:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom5:3-Rom5:4\">Romans 5:3–4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:28\">8:28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:22\">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph5:18\">Ephesians 5:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil3:1\">Philippians 3:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil4:4\">4:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess5:16\">1 Thessalonians 5:16</a></p>",
