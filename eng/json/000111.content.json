    "content": "<p>When God created the first humans in his own image, he created them male and female (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen1:27\">Genesis 1:27</a>). God gave them the ability to have children through their sexuality. This was so they could fill the earth with people and take care of it (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen1:28\">1:28</a>). God also created sexuality so that husbands and wives could share deep friendship and closeness in marriage (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen2:18-Gen2:25\">2:18–25</a>). Being male or female is a basic part of what makes us human. When God looked at everything he had created, including human sexuality, he said it was &quot;very good&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen1:31\">1:31</a>).</p><p>Sexual intimacy united the first man and woman as one. It still does today. Biblical sexuality involves the whole person (physical, emotional, and spiritual). It is meant to reflect the union of body and soul within the context of marriage, which is designed for mutual love and commitment. It supports sexual relations only within a permanent commitment to each each&apos;s well-being. The Bible describes sexual relations as &quot;knowing&quot; another person intimately (see <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"11943\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleStudyNotes\">study note on Genesis 4:1</span>). </p><p>Since creation, God intended sexual activity to occur within marriage. Marriage means a permanent and loving commitment between a man and woman (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen1:27-Gen1:28\">Genesis 1:27–28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen2:23-Gen2:24\">2:23–24</a>). The sexual relationship strengthens the marriage bond and reflects the deep, covenantal union that God designed for husband and wife, with reproduction as one important but not exclusive outcome</p><p>Sexuality existed before sin, but human rebellion affected it. Sexuality is powerful and can easily become corrupted if not guided carefully (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev18:1-Lev18:30\">Leviticus 18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess4:3-1Thess4:8\">1 Thessalonians 4:3–8</a>). Sexual intimacy outside of marriage distorts the order God intended for sexuality. Incest, for example, violates sexual boundaries (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev18:7-Lev18:18\">Leviticus 18:7–18</a>). It ruins family structures and harms the community (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen19:30-Gen19:38\">Genesis 19:30–38</a>). </p><p>Distorted sexuality causes harm and weakens the community (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen38:1-Gen38:30\">Genesis 38:1–30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen39:7-Gen39:9\">39:7–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg19:1-Judg20:48\">Judges 19–20</a>). It overemphasizes the individual (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam13:11-2Sam13:14\">2 Samuel 13:1–14</a>). But, biblical sexuality strengthens both partners and the community.</p><p>Human sexuality was affected when the first humans sinned, leading to brokenness, shame, and distorted desires (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen3:1-Gen3:24\">Genesis 3</a>). Sin distorts God&apos;s good design and leads to the misuse of sexual relations outside of marriage, as well as selfishness and harm in relationships. But God redeemed human sexuality through Jesus Christ&apos;s death and resurrection (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:12-1Cor6:20\">1 Corinthians 6:12–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph5:31-Eph5:33\">Ephesians 5:31–33</a>). He restores sexual wholeness in those who trust in his work by the Holy Spirit (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:9-1Cor6:11\">1 Corinthians 6:9–11</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:15-1Cor6:20\">15–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess4:1-1Thess4:8\">1 Thessalonians 4:1–8</a>). Those who commit their sexuality to Christ&apos;s work in their lives can demonstrate to others God&apos;s love for his people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph5:25-Eph5:33\">Ephesians 5:25–33</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen1:27-Gen1:28\">Genesis 1:27–28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen2:18-Gen2:25\">2:18–25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev18:1-Lev18:30\">Leviticus 18:1–30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut22:13-Deut22:29\">Deuteronomy 22:13–29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ruth4:11-Ruth4:13\">Ruth 4:11–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam11:2-2Sam11:27\">2 Samuel 11:2–27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps127:3-Ps127:5\">Psalm 127:3–5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eccl2:8-Eccl2:11\">Ecclesiastes 2:8–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song1:8-Song8:14\">Song of Solomon 1:8–8:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal2:15-Mal2:16\">Malachi 2:15–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt19:3-Matt19:12\">Matthew 19:3–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:12-1Cor7:40\">1 Corinthians 6:12–7:40</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph5:31-Eph5:33\">Ephesians 5:31–33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess4:3-1Thess4:8\">1 Thessalonians 4:3–8</a></p>",
