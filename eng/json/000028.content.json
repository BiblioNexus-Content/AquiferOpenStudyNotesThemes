    "content": "<p>Scripture describes some leaders as <em>charismatic</em> (gifted) because their authority came from God&apos;s Spirit. God&apos;s Spirit gave them special qualities.</p><p>The Old Testament judges are often part of this group. These charismatic leaders emerged during troubled times in response to problems. In the book of Judges, these problems often happened because the Israelites &quot;<span>did evil in the sight of the LORD.</span>&quot; This led to enemies oppressing Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg3:12\">Judges 3:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg4:1\">4:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg6:1\">6:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg10:6\">Judges 10:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg13:1\">13:1</a>).</p><p>The leadership of the judges followed a pattern. God&apos;s Spirit &quot;came upon&quot; a judge and prophetic support sustained them. At other times in Israel&apos;s history, God gave prophetic messages (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam10:6\">1 Samuel 10:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:2\">2 Samuel 23:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa61:1\">Isaiah 61:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek11:5\">Ezekiel 11:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mic3:8\">Micah 3:8</a>). In the time of the judges, the Spirit at times gave physical strength (for example, to Samson in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg14:6\">Judges 14:6</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg14:19\">19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg15:14\">15:14</a>). The Spirit also sometimes gave skill or leadership power to judges (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg3:10\">Judges 3:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg6:34\">6:34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg11:29\">11:29</a>).</p><p>Jesus and the apostles led people through spiritual power. The Jewish leaders often pointed out that Jesus had no &quot;official&quot; title or authority, yet he showed great power and gained many followers. The apostles were appointed to positions we might call &quot;offices.&quot; While the early church had some basic organization, it was not as structured as it would later become. The authority of the apostles was a gift from the Holy Spirit. Peter&apos;s healing of the beggar indicates the difference between material wealth, like &quot;silver or gold,&quot; and true spiritual power (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts3:1-Acts3:8\">Acts 3:1–8</a>).</p><p>Throughout history, from ancient Israel until today, many leaders have shown God&apos;s power working through them. This kind of leadership depends on God&apos;s Spirit giving them special qualities. But if leaders stop following God&apos;s Spirit, they can lose these special qualities (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg16:20-Judg16:21\">Judges 16:20–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam16:14\">1 Samuel 16:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa63:10\">Isaiah 63:10</a>). Leaders gifted by the Spirit must always remain aware of and rely on that same Spirit.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod31:2-Exod31:5\">Exodus 31:2–5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg2:16-Judg2:19\">Judges 2:16–19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg3:10\">3:10</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg3:27-Judg3:28\">27–28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg6:34-Judg6:35\">6:34–35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg11:29\">11:29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg14:6\">14:6</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg14:19\">19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg15:14\">15:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam10:6\">1 Samuel 10:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam16:13-1Sam16:18\">16:13–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam23:2\">2 Samuel 23:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa61:1\">Isaiah 61:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek11:5\">Ezekiel 11:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mic3:8\">Micah 3:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt3:16-Matt4:2\">Matthew 3:16–4:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts6:8\">Acts 6:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts8:4-Acts8:40\">8:4–40</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:11\">Romans 1:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom12:6-Rom12:8\">12:6–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor12:4-1Cor12:11\">1 Corinthians 12:4–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph4:11-Eph4:12\">Ephesians 4:11–12</a></p>",
