    "content": "<p>First-century Jews wanted a king like David or leader like Judas Maccabeus to defeat their oppressors. Jesus&apos; idea of the kingdom of God was very different from these hopes (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:43-Matt5:48\">Matthew 5:43–48</a>).</p><p>The Gospel of Matthew shows Jesus as a unique teacher, and the sermon on the mount is his longest and most famous sermon. It is more than just a set of Jesus&apos; teachings about right and wrong. It is a guide for living as a citizen in the kingdom of heaven.</p><p>Jesus described the kingdom of heaven as: </p><ol><li><p>a connection with God,</p></li><li><p>a change of heart, and</p></li><li><p>relationships with others. </p></li></ol><p>This new message of the kingdom made a strong impact on those who listened to Jesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt7:28-Matt7:29\">Matthew 7:28–29</a>).</p><p>People often make clear distinctions between these three areas, but all are always present. For example, Jesus&apos; instruction on humility seems inward at first, but it also involves our attitude toward God and others (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:5\">Matthew 5:5</a>). The command not to resist an evil person appears outward-focused (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:39\">5:39</a>). But it often requires active faith in God and inner strength. Jesus&apos; instruction on prayer mainly concerns our relationship with God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt6:5-Matt6:15\">6:5–15</a>). But prayer starts with understanding that you need God&apos;s help. It also often involves your relationships with other people</p><p>To be a citizen in the kingdom of heaven, you must follow Jesus and live a God-centered life, not a self-centered one. Trying to be righteous on your own keeps you in darkness because it is still self-focused. Jesus calls for true righteousness, which is the righteousness of God himself (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:20\">Matthew 5:20</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:48\">48</a>). You cannot achieve this righteousness on your own. Jesus gives it to those who follow him.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt7:24-Matt7:29\">Matthew 7:24–29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt13:1-Matt13:52\">13:1–52</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:14-Mark10:16\">Mark 10:14–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke8:1-Luke8:3\">Luke 8:1–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke9:1-Luke9:6\">9:1–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John3:1-John3:21\">John 3:1–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts8:12\">Acts 8:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts28:23-Acts28:31\">28:23–31</a></p>",
