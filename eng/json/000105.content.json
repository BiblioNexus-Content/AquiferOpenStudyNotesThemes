    "content": "<p>The Bible teaches that people should be holy in their sexual relationships. God created humans as sexual beings. The first command God gave to Adam and Eve was to &quot;Be fruitful and multiply&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen1:28\">Genesis 1:28</a>). This means they should have children. After sin entered the world, the good things God created (including sex) became easily misused or corrupted.</p><p>Scripture contains many examples of sexual sin. God called his people to be holy. The Israelites received many commands that linked sexuality with holiness (see, for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev18:1-Lev18:30\">Leviticus 18:1–30</a>). The sexual purity of God&apos;s people faced serious challenges in the land of Canaan, where many wrong sexual practices were common. Many times, the Israelites failed to follow God&apos;s standards for sexual purity.</p><p>The believers who received Paul&apos;s letters also lived in places where wrong sexual behavior was common. Unlike the sexual freedom of the Greco-Roman world, God&apos;s people were called to be faithful and pure in their sexual lives (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess4:3-1Thess4:8\">1 Thessalonians 4:3–8</a>). Sexual relationships should only happen within marriage (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor7:1-1Cor7:9\">1 Corinthians 7:1–9</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor7:36-1Cor7:37\">36–37</a>).</p><p>God has made Christians holy through the work of his Holy Spirit (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:11\">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess2:13\">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>). Because of this, Christians are called to live as God&apos;s holy people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor1:2\">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>). God has given them everything they need to live a holy life in this world (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet1:3-2Pet1:4\">2 Peter 1:3–4</a>). As a result, Christians should live differently from the unholy world around them. Every part of their life should show the changing work of the Holy Spiritm (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom12:2\">Romans 12:2</a>).</p><p>Sexual relations outside of marriage are not right for anyone who is united with Christ. This kind of behavior harms the Christian&apos;s body, which has become a holy place where God lives and therefore belongs to God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:12-1Cor6:20\">1 Corinthians 6:12–20</a>).</p><p>Though homosexual activity was accepted in Greco-Roman culture, the church has traditionally understood the Bible to condemn it. In both the Old Testament and the New Testament, homosexual activity is described as going against God&apos;s plan for men and women (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev18:22\">Leviticus 18:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev20:13\">20:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:25-Rom1:27\">Romans 1:25–27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:9-1Cor6:11\">1 Corinthians 6:9–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim1:8-1Tim1:11\">1 Timothy 1:8–11</a>).</p><p>Paul strongly warns that people who freely persist in wrong sexual relations, whether homosexual or heterosexual, will not inherit the kingdom of God but will face God&apos;s judgment (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:9-1Cor6:10\">1 Corinthians 6:9–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:19-Gal5:21\">Galatians 5:19–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col3:5-Col3:6\">Colossians 3:5–6</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet2:1-2Pet3:13\">2 Peter 2:1–3:13</a>). However, like all sins, forgiveness and cleansing are offered to anyone who turns to Christ with faith and repentance (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts2:38\">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom3:21-Rom3:26\">Romans 3:21–26</a>; see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:11\">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>). Those who follow Jesus Christ are called to show love, kindness, and mercy to others (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt7:1-Matt7:2\">Matthew 7:1–2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph4:32\">Ephesians 4:32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col3:12-Col3:14\">Colossians 3:12–14</a>). God&apos;s people should live in holiness and godliness, in agreement with the desires of their Creator and Judge (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet3:11-2Pet3:13\">2 Peter 3:11–13</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen2:18-Gen2:25\">Genesis 2:18–25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev18:1-Lev18:30\">Leviticus 18:1–30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev20:10-Lev20:24\">Leviticus 20:10–24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom12:1-Rom12:2\">Romans 12:1–2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor1:2\">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:9-1Cor6:20\">1 Corinthians 6:9–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor7:1-1Cor7:9\">1 Corinthians 7:1–9</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor7:14\">14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:16-Gal5:24\">Galatians 5:16–24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col3:1-Col3:6\">Colossians 3:1–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess4:3-1Thess4:8\">1 Thessalonians 4:3–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet1:13-1Pet1:16\">1 Peter 1:13–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet1:3-2Pet1:4\">2 Peter 1:3–4</a></p>",
