    "content": "<p>As David became successful, King Saul became his enemy. The Lord rejected Saul because of the king&apos;s unfaithfulness, and the Holy Spirit&apos;s anointing then rested on David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam15:1-1Sam16:14\">1 Samuel 15:1–16:14</a>). When Saul needed someone to calm his mind, David&apos;s harp playing soothed him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam16:15-1Sam16:23\">16:15–23</a>). When Saul needed someone to encounter the threat of Goliath, David proved to be a capable and successful young warrior (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam17:1-1Sam17:58\">1 Samuel 17</a>). As others noticed David and praised his success, Saul became frightened and jealous (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam18:6-1Sam18:9\">18:6–9</a>). His jealousy soon became anger, rage, and murderous hatred.</p><p>After King Saul tried to kill David with a spear twice (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam18:10-1Sam18:11\">1 Samuel 18:10–11</a>), David kept serving him. He led a group of the king’s troops (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam18:13\">18:13</a>). He married the king’s daughter (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam18:17-1Sam18:27\">18:17–27</a>). He played the harp in Saul’s royal court (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam19:7\">19:7</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam19:9\">9</a>). David kept succeeding in everything he did. This made Saul very fearful and suspicious, and he tried to kill David again (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam19:9-1Sam19:11\">19:9–11</a>). David had to escape to save his life (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam19:11-1Sam19:18\">19:11–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam20:1-1Sam20:42\">20:1–42</a>).</p><p>For the rest of King Saul’s rule, David was a fugitive, hunted by the king he had loyally served. Even then, he refused to harm Saul. On two occasions, David had the chance to kill Saul (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam24:1-1Sam24:22\">1 Samuel 24:1–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam26:1-1Sam26:25\">26:1–25</a>). But he refused to attack “the LORD’s anointed” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam24:6\">24:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam26:9\">26:9</a>).</p><p>During these years as a fugitive, David continued to serve the Lord and the people of Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam23:1-1Sam23:6\">1 Samuel 23:1–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam25:4-1Sam25:9\">25:4–9</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam25:14-1Sam25:16\">14–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam27:8-1Sam27:9\">27:8–9</a>). When David heard that Saul and Jonathan had died, he mourned deeply for the &quot;beloved and delightful&quot; king and his son (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam1:17-2Sam1:27\">2 Samuel 1:17–27</a>).</p><p>David remained loyal to a king who hated him and wanted him dead. In a similar way, the prophet Jeremiah wrote a prophesy in the royal court where they burned it and put him in a cistern to die (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer36:21-Jer36:26\">Jeremiah 36:21–26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer38:1-Jer38:13\">38:1–13</a>). The prophet Daniel and his friends also faithfully served in the royal courts of Babylonian and Persian. They did this even though the kings made decisions against their faith or them personally (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan3:1-Dan3:30\">Daniel 3:1–30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan6:1-Dan6:28\">6:1–28</a>).</p><p>Being faithful under an enemy&apos;s rule does not always lead to success. Jesus is the ultimate example. The Jewish authorities pursued him and eventually had him killed. Jesus did not achieve worldly success, but he trusted his Father in heaven. His success came after death in the resurrection. </p><p>We might also die while living under leaders who are against us, and we might not see any good results from our suffering. But in the future world that God will bring, he will fix everything that was wrong. God will reward those who remain faithful even when they suffer under cruel leaders.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam24:1-1Sam24:22\">1 Samuel 24:1–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam1:1-2Sam1:27\">2 Samuel 1:1–27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam11:1-2Sam11:27\">11:1–27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer36:21-Jer36:27\">Jeremiah 36:21–27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer38:1-Jer38:13\">38:1–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan3:1-Dan3:30\">Daniel 3:1–30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan6:1-Dan6:28\">6:1–28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John8:29\">John 8:29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil2:6-Phil2:11\">Philippians 2:6–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb5:7-Heb5:10\">Hebrews 5:7–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet2:13-1Pet3:7\">1 Peter 2:13–3:7</a></p>",
