    "content": "<p>Sadly, opposition to God is not limited to those outside the community of faith. The Bible tells of many who seemed to know God but turned away (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num16:1-Num16:50\">Numbers 16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut13:1-Deut13:18\">Deuteronomy 13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:5-2Kgs17:23\">2 Kings 17:5–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek8:1-Ezek8:18\">Ezekiel 8</a>). God brings fair consequences to those who turn away from him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job11:20\">Job 11:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov1:24-Prov1:31\">Proverbs 1:24–31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer11:11\">Jeremiah 11:11</a>). Jesus spoke about those who &quot;fall away&quot; and the judgment they will receive (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt16:27\">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:13\">23:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt24:10-Matt24:13\">24:10–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt25:41-Matt25:46\">25:41–46</a>). The New Testament writers follow his example (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal1:6-Gal1:9\">Galatians 1:6–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim3:1-2Tim3:9\">2 Timothy 3:1–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet2:1-2Pet2:22\">2 Peter 2:1–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John2:18-1John2:19\">1 John 2:18–19</a>).</p><p>The Bible plainly states that disobeying God leads to severe consequences (see, for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen9:5-Gen9:6\">Genesis 9:5–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num35:16-Num35:21\">Numbers 35:16–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev20:10\">Leviticus 20:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech5:4\">Zechariah 5:4</a>). God will eventually separate those who oppose his will and rule from his life-giving presence (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa66:14-Isa66:24\">Isaiah 66:14–24</a>). In a similar way, several passages in the letter to the Hebrews warn those who do not take God&apos;s word seriously. It says that they will experience spiritual trouble and encounter God&apos;s judgment (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb2:1-Heb2:4\">Hebrews 2:1–4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb4:12-Heb4:13\">4:12–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb6:4-Heb6:8\">6:4–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb10:26-Heb10:31\">10:26–31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb12:25-Heb12:29\">12:25–29</a>).</p><p>Scholars interpret the &quot;warning passages&quot; in Hebrews about <em>apostasy</em> (falling away) and judgment in different ways: </p><ol><li><p>Some think the warnings are suggestive. They are meant to arouse listeners from spiritual laziness, without referring to actual judgment. </p></li><li><p>Another view is that the author spoke of his concern about Jewish people who had not yet converted to Christianity. They were under God&apos;s judgment for not yet being part of the new covenant (God&apos;s new agreement or promise with humanity established through Jesus Christ).</p></li><li><p>A third perspective is that the &quot;apostates&quot; were Christians. Because of their spiritual state, they would encounter some of God&apos;s judgment. But, they were not at risk of losing their salvation.</p></li><li><p>A fourth view suggests the apostates were once full members of the Christian community. They had fully experienced the faith. But then turned away from Jesus and the church. </p></li><li><p>A fifth opinion is that the apostates were never true believers. This shows they never really knew Jesus from the start.</p></li></ol><p>Warnings of judgment show God&apos;s grace. They intend to guide rebellious people back to God&apos;s ways. Understanding the consequences of turning away from the Christian faith can strengthen our commitment to follow Jesus faithfully.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num16:1-Num16:50\">Numbers 16:1–50</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut13:1-Deut13:18\">Deuteronomy 13:1–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:5-2Kgs17:23\">2 Kings 17:5–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek8:1-Ezek8:18\">Ezekiel 8:1–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt24:10-Matt24:13\">Matthew 24:10–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal1:6-Gal1:9\">Galatians 1:6–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim3:1-2Tim3:9\">2 Timothy 3:1–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb2:1-Heb2:4\">Hebrews 2:1–4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb6:4-Heb6:8\">6:4–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb10:26-Heb10:31\">10:26–31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet2:1-2Pet2:22\">2 Peter 2:1–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John2:18-1John2:19\">1 John 2:18–19</a></p>",
