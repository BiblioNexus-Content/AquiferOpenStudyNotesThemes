    "content": "<p>In his prayer of dedication, King Solomon said the temple was the house where God would put his name (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr6:20\">2 Chronicles 6:20</a>; compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr6:5-2Chr6:6\">6:5–6</a>). God said that King David would build &quot;a house for My Name&quot; in Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam7:4-2Sam7:17\">2 Samuel 7:4–17</a>). When God puts his name on a place, it means it belongs to God.</p><p>For the people of Israel, the temple represented the land God promised to them and was marked by God&apos;s name. It was the ultimate symbol of God&apos;s relationship with Israel. Solomon prayed that God would remember this relationship and listen to their prayers at the temple. </p><p>In many English Bible translations, Yahweh is represented as &quot;LORD&quot; written in all capital letters<em> </em>(see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:13-Exod3:15\">Exodus 3:13–15</a>). Solomon&apos;s prayer uses God&apos;s personal name. This made the temple the main symbol of Israel&apos;s faith. The temple was the chosen place where the people kept and remembered God&apos;s covenant (the special agreement that God made with the Israelites). This is where the people of Israel called on God&apos;s name and acknowledged him in confession and praise.</p><p>The fulfillment of God&apos;s promise to put his name on his temple is now found in the &quot;living temple,&quot; which is the community of God&apos;s people. The apostle Peter urges believers to come to &quot;the living stone, rejected by men but chosen and precious in God’s sight, you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet2:4-1Pet2:5\">1 Peter 2:4–5</a>). </p><p>Just as God&apos;s name was connected to the temple, the center of God&apos;s presence and worship in the Old Testament, God&apos;s name now rests on the church, God&apos;s people, who are the new temple in the New Testament.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:13-Exod3:15\">Exodus 3:13–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam7:12-2Sam7:13\">2 Samuel 7:12–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr6:3-2Chr6:42\">2 Chronicles 6:3–42</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps23:3\">Psalm 23:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet2:4-1Pet2:5\">1 Peter 2:4–5</a></p>",
