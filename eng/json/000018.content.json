    "content": "<p>To many people today, the New Testament seems to present an extreme view of the Christian life. God calls Christians to give up their rights, endure suffering, and even face death for Jesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark8:34-Mark8:36\">Mark 8:34–36</a>). They must turn away from worldly things that everyone pursues (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John2:15-1John2:17\">1 John 2:15–17</a>). They are to even despise their life in this world (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John12:24-John12:25\">John 12:24–25</a>). Paul advises Christians to give up the usual desires for marriage and family and remain single for Jesus. Yet, this is only if they have that spiritual gift (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor7:7\">1 Corinthians 7:7</a>).</p><p>What is the reason for this extreme view of life? For Paul, it is the understanding that believers belong to Jesus, both body and soul. When Jesus died, he bought them for himself (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:20\">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>). They must no longer live only for themselves and their own desires (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor5:14-2Cor5:15\">2 Corinthians 5:14–15</a>). Having died to their personal interests, he calls them to live fully for their Lord (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom14:7-Rom14:9\">Romans 14:7–9</a>).</p><p>For true Christians, obeying Jesus is not a heavy burden. It is a way to show love and loyalty to the one who died for them. For Jesus&apos; people, life is a joyful way to thank God for the grace shown through Jesus Christ. They are glad to dedicate their lives to serve the one who sacrificed everything for them (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John3:16\">1 John 3:16</a>). By dying to their own desires, Christians allow Christ to live in and through them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal2:19-Gal2:20\">Galatians 2:19–20</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut9:26\">Deuteronomy 9:26</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut9:29\">29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut32:9\">32:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:53\">1 Kings 8:53</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps2:8\">Psalms 2:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps28:9\">28:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek18:4\">Ezekiel 18:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark8:34-Mark8:36\">Mark 8:34–36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark12:30\">12:30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom14:7-Rom14:9\">Romans 14:7–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:19-1Cor6:20\">1 Corinthians 6:19–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor7:20-1Cor7:24\">7:20–24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor7:32-1Cor7:35\">7:32–35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor5:14-2Cor5:15\">2 Corinthians 5:14–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal2:19-Gal2:20\">Galatians 2:19–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet2:9-1Pet2:10\">1 Peter 2:9–10</a></p>",
