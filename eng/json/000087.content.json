    "content": "<p>God directs people and events to achieve his purposes in history. He does not need to explain himself, but he always has a purpose. He guides individuals, nations, and events to achieve his will. This view of history stays consistent throughout biblical history. God uses human actions to achieve results that only his planning can explain.</p><p>The writer of the book of Chronicles explains the division of Israel&apos;s kingdom in a simple way. Rehoboam and his followers “<span>listened to the words of the LORD and turned back from going against Jeroboam</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr11:4\">2 Chronicles 11:4</a>). The reason for the division was Rehoboam&apos;s unreasonable response to the people&apos;s request. This was already explained earlier: “<span>This turn of events was from God, in order that the LORD might fulfill the word that He had spoken through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr10:15\">10:15</a>). Rehoboam might have easily defeated the rebels, but the Lord&apos;s will stopped him.</p><p>Obeying God&apos;s will brought positive results for Rehoboam. He strengthened cities, appointed military leaders, and stocked equipment and food supplies. Loyal citizens moved to his territory, and he had a large family. God&apos;s will was clear, and Rehoboam benefited greatly. Yet, the writer of the Chronicles could not explain God&apos;s purposes. Readers today still wonder why God allowed the kingdom to stay divided.</p><p>The prophet Isaiah reveals the mystery of God&apos;s ways: “For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways,” declares the LORD.<strong><sup> </sup></strong>“For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so My ways are higher than your ways and My thoughts than your thoughts” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa55:8-Isa55:9\">Isaiah 55:8–9</a>). Those who revere God learn not to rely on human understanding. Instead, they obey God&apos;s word, even when it opposes earthly values.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:56-1Kgs8:61\">1 Kings 8:56–61</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr10:1-2Chr11:4\">2 Chronicles 10:1–11:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job42:1-Job42:6\">Job 42:1–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps115:1-Ps115:3\">Psalm 115:1–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa40:9-Isa40:31\">Isaiah 40:9–31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa42:1-Isa42:17\">42:1–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa55:8-Isa55:13\">55:8–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:26-Rom8:30\">Romans 8:26–30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph1:9-Eph1:14\">Ephesians 1:9–14</a></p>",
