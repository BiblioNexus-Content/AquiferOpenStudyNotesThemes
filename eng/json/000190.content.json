    "content": "<p>Sometimes, people urge others to accept Jesus Christ because they promise that he will solve their problems. Yet, Jesus did not promise to solve all problems. He often warned people to think about the cost of following him (see, for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke14:28\">Luke 14:28</a>). He also emphasized the difficulties that would come from choosing to follow him (see, for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark8:34\">Mark 8:34</a>).</p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod5:1-Exod5:23\">Exodus 5</a> gives us an example of how following God can sometimes lead to more challenges at first. In the beginning, Pharaoh made the Hebrew people slaves because he was afraid they were becoming too numerous and might cause problems for Egypt (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod1:8-Exod1:22\">1:8–22</a>). In chapter <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod5:1-Exod5:23\">5</a>, the situation changes. Moses and Aaron had given the people hope by telling them that God would rescue them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:29-Exod4:31\">4:29–31</a>). When Moses and Aaron first met with Pharaoh, they told him that God was the true ruler over all (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod5:1-Exod5:3\">5:1–3</a>). As expected, Pharaoh saw this as a challenge to his power as king, and he responded by making life even harder for the Israelites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod5:4-Exod5:21\">5:4–21</a>).</p><p>When God&apos;s kingdom opposes God&apos;s enemies, conflict and suffering often occur for God&apos;s people. This should not surprise us. When someone becomes a Christian, they leave behind a life controlled by evil and darkness. They begin a new life guided by God&apos;s goodness and light (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col1:11-Col1:14\">Colossians 1:11–14</a>). Those ruling the kingdom of darkness will not let us leave without a fight. We must stand firm in our faith, knowing that God will secure the final victory for us (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod6:1-Exod6:8\">Exodus 6:1–8</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:11-Matt5:12\">Matthew 5:11–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John16:33\">John 16:33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:20\">Romans 16:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph6:10-Eph6:18\">Ephesians 6:10–18</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen39:6-Gen39:20\">Genesis 39:6–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod5:1-Exod5:23\">Exodus 5:1–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod18:8\">18:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:3-1Kgs18:4\">1 Kings 18:3–4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:1-1Kgs19:10\">19:1–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps6:6-Ps6:7\">Psalms 6:6–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps22:11-Ps22:18\">22:11–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:11-Matt5:12\">Matthew 5:11–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark8:34\">Mark 8:34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John15:20\">John 15:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John16:33\">16:33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom16:20\">Romans 16:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor11:23-2Cor11:29\">2 Corinthians 11:23–29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph6:10-Eph6:18\">Ephesians 6:10–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim3:12\">2 Timothy 3:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb10:32-Heb10:36\">Hebrews 10:32–36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet1:6-1Pet1:7\">1 Peter 1:6–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet3:9-1Pet3:17\">3:9–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet4:12-1Pet4:19\">4:12–19</a></p>",
