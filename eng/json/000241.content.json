    "content": "<p>Through his teaching and miracles, Jesus showed that the messianic banquet was ready. The messianic banquet is a special feast that God promised to prepare when the Messiah came. He invited all people to come and receive God&apos;s salvation and become part of God&apos;s kingdom.</p><p>Jesus compared his ministry to a wedding feast, with himself as the groom (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke5:33-Luke5:35\">Luke 5:33–35</a>). The kingdom of God was like a grand banquet. God invited everyone, but some chose not to attend (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke14:15-Luke14:24\">Luke 14:15–24</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt8:11-Matt8:12\">Matthew 8:11–12</a>). Jesus often shared meals with a variety of people. This included disliked tax collectors and committed Pharisees (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke5:29-Luke5:32\">5:29–32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke7:36-Luke7:50\">7:36–50</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke11:37-Luke11:41\">11:37–41</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke14:1-Luke14:6\">14:1–6</a>). </p><p>He also used the imagery of feasting and banquets in his teachings and parables (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke5:33-Luke5:35\">Luke 5:33–35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke12:35-Luke12:38\">12:35–38</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke14:7-Luke14:14\">14:7–14</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke14:15-Luke14:24\">15–24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke17:7-Luke17:10\">17:7–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke22:28-Luke22:30\">22:28–30</a>). Additionally, he fed large crowds with just a few loaves and fishes (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke9:10-Luke9:17\">9:10–17</a>).</p><p>The Old Testament background for this feast imagery is <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa25:6\">Isaiah 25:6</a>. It describes God&apos;s final salvation as a great feast for everyone: “<span>the LORD of Hosts will prepare a lavish banquet for all the peoples, a feast of aged wine, of choice meat, of finely aged wine</span>” (see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa65:13-Isa65:14\">Isaiah 65:13–14</a>).</p><p>Jesus&apos; public ministry began the invitation to the banquet and its beginning. Through his death and resurrection, he brought salvation. Now, everyone can come to God&apos;s banquet table and receive the kingdom&apos;s spiritual blessings. Yet, this banquet will fully happen in the future kingdom. Then, Jesus&apos; disciples will &quot;<span>eat and drink at My table in My kingdom</span>&quot; and &quot;<span>sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke22:30\">Luke 22:30</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev19:7-Rev19:9\">Revelation 19:7–9</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa25:6\">Isaiah 25:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa65:13-Isa65:14\">65:13–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke5:29-Luke5:35\">Luke 5:29–35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke6:21\">6:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke7:36-Luke7:50\">7:36–50</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke9:10-Luke9:17\">9:10–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke11:37-Luke11:41\">11:37–41</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke12:35-Luke12:40\">12:35–40</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke13:24-Luke13:30\">13:24–30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke14:1-Luke14:24\">14:1–24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke17:8\">17:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke22:30\">22:30</a></p>",
