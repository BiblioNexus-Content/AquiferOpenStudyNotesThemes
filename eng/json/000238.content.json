    "content": "<p>Both the Old Testament and the New Testament state that the Lord is the one true God. God is supreme over all nations and peoples at all times. Even if rulers do not believe in or acknowledge him, God remains in control. Kings and emperors might think they control everything in their lands, but they are mistaken. The Lord God is ultimately in charge.</p><p>The Old Testament prophets said that the Lord God of Israel chose the kings or emperors of each nation. God held rulers accountable for the morality of their policies and how they practiced them. This idea is clear in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer18:1-Jer18:23\">Jeremiah 18</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer25:1-Jer25:38\">25</a>, and <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer46:1-Jer51:64\">46–51</a>.</p><p>Nations that did not acknowledge the one true God would encounter severe judgment. For some nations, God promised that a small group (called a remnant) would survive (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer46:1-Jer51:64\">Jeremiah 46–51</a>).</p><p>The Lord wants people from every nation to turn to him and follow him with sincere hearts and complete dedication. He has always wanted all people to live righteous lives and experience the joy of truly worshiping him. The book of Revelation describes people from every nation, tribe, and language worshiping God in the future (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev7:9-Rev7:10\">Revelation 7:9–10</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod8:20-Exod8:22\">Exodus 8:20–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod9:29\">9:29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:22-2Kgs19:37\">2 Kings 19:22–37</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer18:5-Jer18:11\">Jeremiah 18:5–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer25:15-Jer25:29\">25:15–29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer46:1-Jer51:64\">46:1–51:64</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan2:19-Dan2:21\">Daniel 2:19–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan4:34-Dan4:37\">4:34–37</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hag2:7\">Haggai 2:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt28:18-Matt28:20\">Matthew 28:18–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts12:21-Acts12:23\">Acts 12:21–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom13:1-Rom13:7\">Romans 13:1–7</a></p>",
