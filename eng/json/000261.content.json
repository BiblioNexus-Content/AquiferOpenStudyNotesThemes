    "content": "<p>The book of Job invites readers to examine why we have faith in God. Job lost his possessions, family, and friends. This deeply tested his faith. Yet, he kept trusting God and proved that when Satan accused him, Satan was wrong.</p><p>Sin causes suffering, but the book of Job shows that suffering is not always because of a person&apos;s sin. Human suffering is more complex than just behavior and consequence. Some people today wrongly believe that being godly leads to material wealth, like Job&apos;s friends did. This view has problems, as history shows. There are many examples of righteous people who suffer, including Jesus Christ. </p><p>Scripture tells us that Christians must also share in Christ&apos;s suffering. It says &quot;<span>our present sufferings are not comparable to the glory that will be revealed in us&quot;</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:17-Rom8:18\">Romans 8:17–18</a>). Being a disciple of Christ means being willing to follow him into suffering (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke9:23-Luke9:25\">Luke 9:23–25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil3:10-Phil3:11\">Philippians 3:10–11</a>).</p><p>Even in his complaints, Job recognized that only God could provide the answers he needed. When Job wished for death, he sought relief until God could deal him under better conditions (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job14:13\">Job 14:13</a>). When Job wanted &quot;a mediator,&quot; it was to help him find favor with God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job9:33-Job9:35\">9:33–35</a>). When Job complained that God did not listen, it was because he knew his answers had to come from God (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job19:25-Job19:27\">19:25–27</a>). This is essential to faith.</p><p>We cannot know or understand everything (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen2:16-Gen2:17\">Genesis 2:16–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut29:29\">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:7\">Acts 1:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess5:1-1Thess5:2\">1 Thessalonians 5:1–2</a>). Some things are for God alone to understand and guide according to his will. We should live by faith. Even when we suffer, we can trust God (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:26-Rom8:39\">Romans 8:26–39</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen4:4-Gen4:8\">Genesis 4:4–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen26:17-Gen26:33\">26:17–33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen31:38-Gen31:42\">31:38–42</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen37:2-Gen37:36\">37:2–36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen39:1-Gen39:20\">39:1–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod1:8-Exod1:11\">Exodus 1:8–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam18:10-1Sam18:11\">1 Samuel 18:10–11</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam18:28-1Sam18:29\">28–29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam19:10\">19:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam22:1-1Sam22:19\">22:1–19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:1-1Kgs21:15\">1 Kings 21:1–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr24:20-2Chr24:22\">2 Chronicles 24:20–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job9:33-Job9:35\">Job 9:33–35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job14:13\">14:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Job19:25-Job19:27\">19:25–27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa54:17\">Isaiah 54:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer11:18-Jer11:21\">Jeremiah 11:18–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer26:1-Jer26:23\">26:1–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer38:1-Jer38:13\">38:1–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:29-Matt23:37\">Matthew 23:29–37</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John5:24\">John 5:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John15:20\">15:20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts6:8-Acts7:60\">Acts 6:8–7:60</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:17-Rom8:18\">Romans 8:17–18</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:26-Rom8:39\">26–39</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb12:1-Heb12:13\">Hebrews 12:1–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet4:12-1Pet4:16\">1 Peter 4:12–16</a></p>",
