    "content": "<p>Moses instructed the Israelites as they were about to enter the promised land. They had a choice. They could obey the covenant, which is life as God designed it, and live. Or they could refuse to obey the creator&apos;s design and die (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut30:19\">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>). This choice and its consequences continued throughout the time of God&apos;s covenant with Israel.</p><p>The specific language of Deuteronomy 30 appears again in the prophecy of Jeremiah during the Babylonian invasion. God said, “<span>Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer21:8\">Jeremiah 21:8</a>). The prophet warned King Zedekiah and his people to obey the Lord’s instruction. If they obeyed, they would live, if not, they would die. </p><p>Earlier in Jeremiah’s prophetic ministry, the Lord gave the people of Judah a chance to repent (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer3:12-Jer4:4\">Jeremiah 3:12–4:4</a>). They must stop idol worship, admit their guilt, and confess their rebellion. Then God would cleanse their minds and hearts. He would allow them to live peacefully in the land. Yet, the people continued to reject this offer (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer7:5-Jer7:7\">Jeremiah 7:5–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer18:8-Jer18:11\">18:8–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer23:22\">23:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer26:13\">26:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer27:12-Jer27:13\">27:12–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer29:32\">29:32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer35:15\">35:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer36:3-Jer36:7\">36:3–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer44:5\">44:5</a>). So the Lord continued to warn them that rejecting the path of life would lead to judgment.</p><p>In Jeremiah&apos;s time, only a few chose life. Most rebelled and died. Ultimately, the people led by King Zedekiah ignored the Lord. They rebelled against the Babylonian army, and suffered judgment. They deliberately rejected the gift of life.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut11:26-Deut11:29\">Deuteronomy 11:26–29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut30:15-Deut30:20\">30:15–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov9:1-Prov9:18\">Proverbs 9:1–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov11:19\">11:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov18:21\">18:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa1:19-Isa1:20\">Isaiah 1:19–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer3:12-Jer3:15\">Jeremiah 3:12–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer4:3-Jer4:4\">4:3–4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer7:5-Jer7:7\">7:5–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer18:7-Jer18:11\">18:7–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer21:8-Jer21:9\">21:8–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer23:22\">23:22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer26:13\">26:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer27:12-Jer27:18\">27:12–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer35:15\">35:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer36:3-Jer36:7\">36:3–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer44:5\">44:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek18:23-Ezek18:24\">Ezekiel 18:23–24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom6:23\">Romans 6:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:6\">8:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev2:10\">Revelation 2:10</a></p>",
