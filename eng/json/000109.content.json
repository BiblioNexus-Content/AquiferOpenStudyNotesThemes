    "content": "<p>In the first century, many Jews hoped the Messiah (God&apos;s chosen one) would come. They thought this rescuer would defeat Israel&apos;s enemies and bring peace and prosperity to God&apos;s people.</p><p>The Hebrew word &quot;Messiah&quot; and the Greek word &quot;Christ&quot; both mean &quot;anointed one.&quot; This term comes from the tradition of anointing Israelite kings with oil at their coronation. This act confirmed their role as God&apos;s representative to rule the nation. Later, the term referred to the future king for which Israel hoped. </p><p>Many people hoped for a king from David&apos;s family line to restore David&apos;s dynasty and rule with righteousness and justice in Jerusalem. This hope came from the special agreement (the covenant) God made in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam7:11-2Sam7:16\">2 Samuel 7:11–16</a>. God promised King David that his descendants would rule forever. As Israel&apos;s kingdom decreased and eventually ended, Old Testament prophets predicted the coming of the Christ (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa9:6-Isa9:7\">Isaiah 9:6–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa11:1-Isa11:5\">11:1–5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer23:5-Jer23:6\">Jeremiah 23:5–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer33:15-Jer33:16\">33:15–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek37:24-Ezek37:25\">Ezekiel 37:24–25</a>). This Christ would rescue God&apos;s people and rule forever as David&apos;s successor.</p><p>The gospel writers focus on showing that Jesus is the promised Christ (see, for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt1:21-Matt1:23\">Matthew 1:21–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:32-Luke1:33\">Luke 1:32–33</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke1:69-Luke1:70\">69–70</a>). Yet, he fulfilled these promises in an unexpected way. After Peter said Jesus is “<span>The Christ of God</span>,” Jesus began teaching about the Christ&apos;s suffering (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke9:20-Luke9:22\">Luke 9:20–22</a>). As Jesus neared Jerusalem for the last time, people recognized him as, &quot;<span>the King who comes in the name of the Lord&quot;</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke18:36-Luke18:38\">Luke 18:36–38</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke19:36-Luke19:38\">19:36–38</a>). Yet, later these same people rejected him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke22:66-Luke22:71\">Luke 22:66–71</a>). They crucified and mocked him as “<span>THE KING OF THE JEWS</span>” and “the Christ of God” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke23:35-Luke23:39\">Luke 23:35–39</a>).</p><p>On the third day, Jesus rose from the dead just as he said he would. During his appearances to the disciples, he explained that the Scriptures always prophesied that t<span>he Christ (or Messiah) would have to &quot;suffer these things and then to enter His glory</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:26\">Luke 24:26</a>). Jesus&apos; death and resurrection confirm that he is truly the Christ. His death brings &quot;repentance and forgiveness of sins&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:46-Luke24:47\">24:46–47</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam7:11-2Sam7:16\">2 Samuel 7:11–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa9:6-Isa9:7\">Isaiah 9:6–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa11:1-Isa11:5\">11:1–5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer23:5-Jer23:6\">Jeremiah 23:5–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer33:15-Jer33:16\">33:15–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek37:24-Ezek37:25\">Ezekiel 37:24–25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke2:25-Luke2:32\">Luke 2:25–32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke3:15\">3:15</a></p>",
