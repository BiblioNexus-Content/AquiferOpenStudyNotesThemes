    "content": "<p>The God of the universe feels sorrow when his people suffer (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg10:16\">Judges 10:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos11:8-Hos11:9\">Hosea 11:8–9</a>). Even when people reject him, God&apos;s love is stronger than his justice. His compassion is greater than his judgment. Yet, this does not mean his love cancels his justice. People will face judgment for their choices and actions in the end (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:1\">2 Timothy 4:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev20:11-Rev20:15\">Revelation 20:11–15</a>).</p><p>The era of the Israelite judges shows how God responds when his people repeatedly reject him. There comes a time, like when Noah lived, when God no longer exercises patience (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen6:5-Gen6:7\">Genesis 6:5–7</a>). For the Israelites living at the time of the judges, that moment had arrived. </p><p>After they worshiped other gods, God let their enemies oppress them. He told them, “<span>Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen. Let them save you in your time of trouble</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg10:14\">Judges 10:14</a>). Yet, when Israel asked for mercy again, removed their idols, and accepted the Lord&apos;s justice, God helped them (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg10:10\">10:10</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg10:15-Judg10:16\">15–16</a>).</p><p>God wants people to repent because he does not want to destroy anyone (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Pet3:9\">2 Peter 3:9</a>). He does this &quot;to justify the one who has faith in Jesus&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom3:26\">Romans 3:26</a>). &quot;<span>He bore the sin of many&quot;</span> and offers us the chance to receive his grace (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa53:3-Isa53:12\">Isaiah 53:3–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor5:19-2Cor5:21\">2 Corinthians 5:19–21</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen6:5-Gen6:7\">Genesis 6:5–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg10:6-Judg10:16\">Judges 10:6–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa5:1-Isa5:7\">Isaiah 5:1–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa53:3-Isa53:12\">53:3–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa63:10\">63:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos11:8-Hos11:9\">Hosea 11:8–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph4:30\">Ephesians 4:30</a></p>",
