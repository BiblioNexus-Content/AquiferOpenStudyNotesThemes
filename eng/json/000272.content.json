    "content": "<p>In the Gospels, Jesus has many titles, such as Messiah (or Christ), Son of David, Son of Man, Son of God, and Lord. In Luke, an important title is &quot;Prophet.&quot; Jesus is the prophet Moses predicted in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut18:15\">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>.</p><p>As a prophet, Jesus preached God&apos;s word and performed miracles like the great prophets of the Old Testament. When Jesus raised a widow&apos;s son, the people exclaimed, “<span>A great prophet has appeared among us!</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke7:16\">Luke 7:16</a>). The disciples told Jesus that people were calling him a prophet (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt16:13-Matt16:14\">Matthew 16:13–14</a>). The disciples on the road to Emmaus described him as “<span>a prophet, powerful in speech and action before God and all the people</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:19\">Luke 24:19</a>).</p><p>Like other prophets, Jesus suffered for his message (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:1-1Kgs19:18\">1 Kings 19:1–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer11:18-Jer11:19\">Jeremiah 11:18–19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer18:18\">18:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer20:1-Jer20:2\">20:1–2</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer20:7-Jer20:18\">7–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer26:7-Jer26:11\">26:7–11</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer26:20-Jer26:23\">20–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer38:1-Jer38:6\">38:1–6</a>). People connected Jesus&apos; role as a prophet to his miracles and teaching. But Jesus linked it mainly to his suffering. In Nazareth, he stated that “<span>no prophet is accepted in his hometown</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke4:24\">Luke 4:24</a>). He later accused Israel’s leaders of killing their prophets (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke11:47-Luke11:51\">11:47–51</a>). As he traveled to Jerusalem, he said, “<span>it is not admissible for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke13:33\">13:33</a>).</p><p>In the Old Testament, when Israel ignored God&apos;s prophets, divine judgment came. Similarly, God&apos;s people would encounter judgment if they did not listen to Jesus (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts3:22-Acts3:23\">Acts 3:22–23</a>).</p><p>The revelation that Jesus is the Messiah (God&apos;s chosen one) shows he is the savior for all people. His role as a prophet shows his message is from God. His words are truly God&apos;s words, which people must hear and follow.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut18:15\">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:12\">Matthew 5:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:34-Matt23:37\">23:34–37</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke4:22-Luke4:24\">Luke 4:22–24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke6:23\">6:23</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke6:26\">26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke7:16\">7:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke11:47-Luke11:52\">11:47–52</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke13:33-Luke13:34\">13:33–34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:17-Luke24:21\">24:17–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts3:22-Acts3:23\">Acts 3:22–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts7:37\">7:37</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts7:52\">52</a></p>",
