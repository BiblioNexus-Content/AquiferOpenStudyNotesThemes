    "content": "<p>The prophet Haggai commanded his audience to think about how failing to pay attention to their relationship with God affected their current situation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hag1:5-Hag1:7\">Haggai 1:5–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hag2:15-Hag2:18\">2:15–18</a>). God sent natural disasters as a warning to encourage repentance (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hag2:17\">2:17</a>). Haggai understood that spiritual renewal needed to happen at the same time as rebuilding the temple (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hag1:12\">1:12</a>).</p><p>The theme of spiritual renewal connects the prophets Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi. They all came after the exile to Babylon. God returned his people to their land, as promised by earlier prophets. Yet, the people needed to focus on their spiritual condition to avoid more problems. The risk of disobeying God during this time shows the need for the Lord&apos;s &quot;servant&quot; to come (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hag2:23\">Haggai 2:23</a>). </p><p>This servant first referred to Zerubbabel but later became regarded as the Messiah (God&apos;s chosen one). A righteous shepherd-king was coming (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech9:9\">Zechariah 9:9</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal3:1\">Malachi 3:1</a>). God&apos;s presence would return in an obvious way. God would restore creation. The worship of the Lord would become universal.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut30:2-Deut30:4\">Deuteronomy 30:2–4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps22:27\">Psalm 22:27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa11:9-Isa12:6\">Isaiah 11:9–12:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa44:22\">44:22</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa44:26-Isa44:28\">26–28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa61:6-Isa61:7\">61:6–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer24:4-Jer24:7\">Jeremiah 24:4–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos4:6-Amos4:12\">Amos 4:6–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hag1:7-Hag1:15\">Haggai 1:7–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech9:9\">Zechariah 9:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Zech14:9\">14:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal3:1\">Malachi 3:1</a></p>",
