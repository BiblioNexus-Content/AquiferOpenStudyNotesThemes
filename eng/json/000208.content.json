    "content": "<p>The gospel story of the two disciples on the road to Emmaus is important. It shows Jesus&apos; victory over death and reveals his role as the Messiah (God&apos;s chosen one). It also connects to Old Testament prophecies about him.</p><p>The two disciples told their unknown traveling companion that Jesus was a great prophet because of his teachings and miracles. They had hoped he was the Messiah. When the Jewish leaders arrested and crucified him, these two disciples became desperate and discouraged.</p><p>Jesus scolded them for not reading the Scriptures carefully. The Scriptures had always prophesied the Messiah&apos;s suffering. The apostle Luke then describes how Jesus guided the two disciples through the Scriptures, explaining “<span>explained to them what was written in all the Scriptures about Himself</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:27\">Luke 24:27</a>).</p><p>Jesus does not indicate which Old Testament passages talk about the suffering Christ. But other passages from Luke&apos;s writings refer to various texts: </p><ul><li><p>Jesus is &quot;the stone the builders rejected&quot; that &quot;has become the cornerstone,&quot; for a new temple of God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps118:22\">Psalm 118:22</a>, cited in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke20:17\">Luke 20:17</a>). </p></li><li><p>He is the suffering servant of the Lord, treated like a common criminal (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa53:12\">Isaiah 53:12</a>, cited in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke22:37\">Luke 22:37</a>). </p></li><li><p>His opponents mock, insult, and spit upon him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa50:6\">Isaiah 50:6</a>, suggested in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke18:32\">Luke 18:32</a>). </p></li><li><p>He is the anointed king rejected by the leaders and the people of Israel, but declared innocent by God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps2:1-Ps2:2\">Psalm 2:1–2</a>, cited in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts4:25-Acts4:28\">Acts 4:25–28</a>). </p></li><li><p>He is the descendant of King David who God will not abandon to the grave (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps16:8-Ps16:11\">Psalm 16:8–11</a>, cited in <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts2:25-Acts2:28\">Acts 2:25–28</a>).</p></li></ul><p>According to <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:27\">Luke 24:27</a>, Jesus reviewed Israel&apos;s history and showed how it anticipates and achieves its purpose (climax) with Jesus the Messiah, God&apos;s agent of salvation. This is similar to how the apostle Paul describes <span>Christ as &quot;the end of the law</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom10:4\">Romans 10:4</a>). All the Old Testament Scriptures, including the law of Moses, the prophets, and the Psalms, show God&apos;s story of salvation (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:44\">Luke 24:44</a>). This story achieves its purpose in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke24:13-Luke24:49\">Luke 24:13–49</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom10:4\">Romans 10:4</a></p>",
