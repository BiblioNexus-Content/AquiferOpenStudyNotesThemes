    "content": "<p>Jerusalem was an active city as early as four hundred years before the time of King David. The Israelites never fully captured it when they conquered Canaan or during the time of the judges (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:63\">Joshua 15:63</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:8\">Judges 1:8</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:21\">21</a>). Israel established peaceful relations with the independent area of the Jebusites (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg19:10-Judg19:12\">Judges 19:10–12</a>). Jerusalem was so difficult to capture that the Old Testament mentions only three successful invaders: David, Jehoash, and Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:11-2Kgs14:14\">2 Kings 14:11–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:1-2Kgs25:10\">2 Kings 25:1–10</a>).</p><p>King David captured Jerusalem, possibly through a water tunnel (see <span data-bnType=\"resourceReference\" data-resourceId=\"14296\" data-resourceType=\"TyndaleStudyNotes\">study note on 5:8</span>). He made Jerusalem the political capital of Israel. Then later it became the spiritual capital. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps48:1-Ps48:14\">Psalm 48</a> gives a beautiful and powerful description of Jerusalem as a fortress. It had towers, walls (bulwarks), and easily defended heights (citadels) on rugged terrain. This could have deceived those living there with a false sense of security or even idolatry. <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps48:1-Ps48:3\">Psalm 48:1–3</a> reminds readers that Jerusalem&apos;s landscape did not make it safe, but because God was present.</p><p>Both the Old Testament and the New Testament call Jerusalem a &quot;holy city&quot; (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh11:1\">Nehemiah 11:1</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh11:18\">18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa52:1\">Isaiah 52:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Dan9:24\">Daniel 9:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt4:5\">Matthew 4:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt27:53\">27:53</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:2\">Revelation 21:2</a>). It is the only city described this way in the Bible. Why is this city considered holy? It is certainly not because of the holiness of its people. In fact, the Babylonians destroyed the city in 586 BC because the people were so unholy. </p><p>It was also not holy because it was Israel&apos;s capital for many centuries. Jerusalem was a holy city because God chose it (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:44\">1 Kings 8:44</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:48\">48</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:13\">11:13</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:32\">32</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:36\">36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr6:5\">2 Chronicles 6:5</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr6:34\">34</a>). Because he chose it, he placed his glory and his name there (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:21\">1 Kings 14:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr12:13\">2 Chronicles 12:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek8:1-Ezek10:22\">Ezekiel 8–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek43:1-Ezek43:27\">43:1–27</a>).</p><p>In the gospels and book of Acts, Jerusalem remained very important. Herod the Great was king of Judea from 37–4 BC. He expanded the city of Jerusalem and led major building projects, including the temple. It was still the center of Israel’s spiritual life (see, for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts2:46\">Acts 2:46</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts3:1-Acts3:26\">3:1–26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts5:12\">5:12</a>). Many events in the lives of Jesus and his followers happened in Jerusalem. </p><p>Jesus spoke harshly about Jerusalem (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:37-Matt23:39\">Matthew 23:37–39</a>). He was especially harsh towards its leaders. They eventually killed him in Jerusalem. Jesus warned that God would judge the city (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark13:1-Mark13:2\">Mark 13:1–2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke21:20-Luke21:24\">Luke 21:20–24</a>). His words came true when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem in AD 70.</p><p>The New Testament also introduces &quot;the new Jerusalem,&quot; a heavenly city formed by God&apos;s holy people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb11:10\">Hebrews 11:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev3:12\">Revelation 3:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:2\">21:2</a>). The earthly Jerusalem was where God and his rule were partly present through King David and his successors. The new Jerusalem represents the government of Jesus Christ, the final royal heir of David. The New Jerusalem also represents Jesus&apos; eternal presence with his people (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:14\">John 1:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:3\">Revelation 21:3</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh15:63\">Joshua 15:63</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:8\">Judges 1:8</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:21\">21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam5:6-2Sam5:9\">2 Samuel 5:6–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:1\">1 Kings 8:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:13-2Kgs18:17\">2 Kings 18:13–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:1-2Kgs25:10\">25:1–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr3:1\">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr12:1-2Chr12:12\">12:1–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr26:9\">26:9</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr26:15\">15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr32:1-2Chr32:5\">32:1–5</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr32:27-2Chr32:30\">27–30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra1:1-Ezra1:6\">Ezra 1:1–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh1:1-Neh6:19\">Nehemiah 1:1–6:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps48:1-Ps48:3\">Psalm 48:1–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps125:2\">125:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa14:32\">Isaiah 14:32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa52:1-Isa52:3\">52:1–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal4:25-Gal4:26\">Galatians 4:25–26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb12:22-Heb12:24\">Hebrews 12:22–24</a></p>",
