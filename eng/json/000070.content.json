    "content": "<p>The Arabic term <em>jihad,</em> now familiar in English, refers to a &quot;holy war&quot; where men fight for God. Yet, the Bible describes a &quot;holy war&quot; differently. In the Bible, a holy war is a conflict where God fights for his people as they trust in him. In these wars, victory relies on obedience to God, not on weapons.</p><p>During a war, King Jehoshaphat of Judah declared a fast and prayed to God with a lament (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr20:3\">2 Chronicles 20:3,</a> <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr20:5-2Chr20:12\">5–12</a>). This prayer included calling on God, complaining, confessing trust, and requesting. </p><p>Jehoshaphat and the people showed their humility by bowing with their faces to the ground (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr20:18\">2 Chronicles 20:18</a>). It is surprising to see an army led by a choir praising God as they march into battle (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr20:21\">20:21</a>). Usually battlefields are not for worship and praise. Yet, worship helps people understand God&apos;s will and invites him to save his people. God rewards trust in him. In Jehoshaphat’s case, God defeated a large enemy alliance without Israel needing to fight at all (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr20:22-2Chr20:24\">20:22–24</a>).</p><p>The New Testament shows Jesus as the conqueror of all forces against God&apos;s kingdom (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph1:19-Eph1:21\">Ephesians 1:19–21</a>). In the end, Jesus will defeat all enemies (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor15:24-1Cor15:28\">1 Corinthians 15:24–28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev19:11-Rev20:15\">Revelation 19:11–20:15</a>). This victory will make God&apos;s rule and worship complete: “<span>Hallelujah! For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev19:6\">Revelation 19:6</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh6:1-Josh6:20\">Joshua 6:1–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh10:7-Josh10:15\">10:7–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg7:7-Judg7:22\">Judges 7:7–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:14-2Kgs19:37\">2 Kings 19:14–37</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr6:34-2Chr6:35\">2 Chronicles 6:34–35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr20:5-2Chr20:7\">20:5–7</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr20:20-2Chr20:24\">20–24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa26:21-Isa27:6\">Isaiah 26:21–27:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jonah3:4-Jonah3:10\">Jonah 3:4–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt16:18\">Matthew 16:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor10:3-2Cor10:6\">2 Corinthians 10:3–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph1:19-Eph1:23\">Ephesians 1:19–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph6:10-Eph6:20\">6:10–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev19:11-Rev19:21\">Revelation 19:11–21</a></p>",
