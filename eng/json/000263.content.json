    "content": "<p>A servant-leader is a person who has a strong desire to achieve a goal by helping and serving others. This type of leader desires to take on the role of a servant rather than focusing on their own authority or status.</p><p>The Old Testament describes Moses as the Lord’s servant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod14:31\">Exodus 14:31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num12:7-Num12:8\">Numbers 12:7–8</a>). Moses did not seek power, fame, or material gain. He hesitated to assume his leadership role. He used his prophetic authority with humility (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num12:3\">Numbers 12:3</a>). He knew he was under God&apos;s authority (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut34:10-Deut34:12\">Deuteronomy 34:10–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos12:13\">Hosea 12:13</a>). </p><p>From the time God called him, every event in Moses’ story shows that he regarded his leadership as service to God. He submitted to God, did not care for himself, and was faithful. The way he acted toward the Israelites showed concern, a desire to persuade, and vision. Moses took a leadership role at a critical moment in Israelite history and often prayed or interceded for the people. He humbly submitted to God, which was the foundation of his great leadership.</p><p>Jesus of Nazareth is the perfect servant-leader. The gospels show Jesus as the Lord’s “suffering servant” (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa52:13-Isa53:12\">Isaiah 52:13–53:12</a>). This was especially shown through his sacrificial death, the ultimate act of service (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:45\">Mark 10:45</a>). Jesus spoke with great authority but with humility. He knew his role was like a shepherd who &quot;<span>lays down His life for the sheep&quot;</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John10:11\">John 10:11</a>). </p><p>He spent time with children and used them as examples for those who want to fully follow God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt18:4\">Matthew 18:4</a>). When James and John asked for important positions in his kingdom, Jesus criticized their worldly ambition (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:35-Mark10:45\">Mark 10:35–45</a>). He corrected them by teaching them to follow his example as a servant (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt20:24-Matt20:28\">Matthew 20:24–28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:11-Matt23:12\">23:11–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:43-Mark10:45\">Mark 10:43–45</a>). As a model for all who want to lead others through a life of service, Jesus knew his purpose was to bring glory to God’s name (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John12:27-John12:28\">John 12:27–28</a>).</p><p>The apostles Paul and Peter followed Christ&apos;s example and lived according to his ideal of servant leadership. Paul&apos;s life of service showed humility and self-sacrifice for others (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor11:23-2Cor11:28\">2 Corinthians 11:23–28</a>). He taught Christians to do the same (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:17\">Romans 8:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:13\">Galatians 5:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:8\">2 Timothy 1:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:3\">2:3</a>). He praised those who did (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil2:25-Phil2:30\">Philippians 2:25–30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col4:7\">Colossians 4:7</a>). </p><p>Peter also showed self-sacrificial service for Christ (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts3:1-Acts3:11\">Acts 3:1–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts4:13-Acts4:22\">4:13–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts5:12-Acts5:16\">5:12–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts9:32-Acts9:42\">9:32–42</a>). His instructions plainly define the character of a servant-leader (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet4:10-1Pet4:11\">1 Peter 4:10–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet5:1-1Pet5:5\">5:1–5</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen13:8-Gen13:12\">Genesis 13:8–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen14:11-Gen14:24\">14:11–24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen30:31-Gen30:32\">30:31–32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod14:31\">Exodus 14:31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num12:3\">Numbers 12:3</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num12:7-Num12:8\">7–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut34:10-Deut34:12\">Deuteronomy 34:10–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:1-1Kgs12:7\">1 Kings 12:1–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa52:13-Isa53:12\">Isaiah 52:13–53:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt18:4\">Matthew 18:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt20:24-Matt20:28\">20:24–28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt23:11-Matt23:12\">23:11–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:35-Mark10:45\">Mark 10:35–45</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John10:11\">John 10:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John12:27-John12:28\">12:27–28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts3:1-Acts3:11\">Acts 3:1–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts4:13-Acts4:22\">4:13–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts5:12-Acts5:16\">5:12–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts9:32-Acts9:42\">9:32–42</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:17\">Romans 8:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor11:23-2Cor11:27\">2 Corinthians 11:23–27</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:13\">Galatians 5:13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil2:25-Phil2:30\">Philippians 2:25–30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col4:7\">Colossians 4:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:8\">2 Timothy 1:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:3\">2:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet4:10-1Pet4:11\">1 Peter 4:10–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet5:1-1Pet5:5\">5:1–5</a></p>",
