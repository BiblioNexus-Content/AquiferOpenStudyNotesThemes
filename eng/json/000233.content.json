    "content": "<p>The land was very important to ancient Israel because agriculture was the main way people made a living. Most Israelites were farmers or herders, and their survival depended on the land’s ability to produce crops and support livestock. </p><p>God gave the Israelites the privilege and responsibility of living in Canaan. This was part of God&apos;s covenant with Israel (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:33-1Kgs8:40\">1 Kings 8:33–40</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut28:1-Deut28:68\">Deuteronomy 28</a>). The land was central to Israel’s relationship with God, who promised it to Abraham and his descendants (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:3\">Genesis 12:1–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen13:14-Gen13:17\">13:14–17</a>). The nation of Israel lived as those who tended and owned the land. The land was Israel’s &quot;<span>inheritance</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut4:21\">Deuteronomy 4:21</a>). God gave it to them and required their loyalty (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut4:40\">Deuteronomy 4:40</a>). God expected the people to manage the land well and serve him faithfully.</p><p>Sadly, God&apos;s people chose their own way to live. They worshiped pagan gods and themselves (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:7-2Kgs17:17\">2 Kings 17:7–17</a>). So, God allowed foreign nations to gradually take Israel&apos;s land (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:20-2Kgs8:22\">2 Kings 8:20–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs13:1-2Kgs13:3\">13:1–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:3\">17:3</a>). Eventually, Assyria invaded the northern kingdom, sending the Israelites into exile (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:5-2Kgs17:6\">17:5–6</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:22-2Kgs17:23\">22–23</a>). </p><p>Through these events, God warned Judah, the southern kingdom, that they would lose their land if they did not change (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:8\">2 Kings 21:8</a>). Unfortunately, they did not listen (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:9\">21:9</a>). Their unfaithfulness led to them being forced out of the land by the Babylonians (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:1-2Kgs25:7\">25:1–21</a>).</p><p>Israel&apos;s rebellion and failure to manage the land God gave them is a warning to us. God has redeemed us through Christ Jesus so we can live faithful and productive lives (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John15:16\">John 15:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph2:4-Eph2:10\">Ephesians 2:4–10</a>). If we are unfaithful and unproductive, we might lose our role in serving Christ (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John15:1-John15:2\">John 15:1–2</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John15:6\">6</a>). By remaining connected to him, we &quot;<span>bear much fruit</span>&quot; and grow in our faith (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John15:5\">John 15:5</a>).</p><p>God&apos;s people always have a tendency to sin (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom3:23\">Romans 3:23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John1:8\">1 John 1:8</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John1:10\">10</a>). But God is always ready to forgive and restore those who repent and to renew the blessings of his covenant (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John1:9\">1 John 1:9</a>). Jesus, who mediates the new covenant between God and his people, is also their advocate in heaven (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:27-Matt26:28\">Matthew 26:27–28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1John2:1\">1 John 2:1</a>). In the end, those who remain faithful to God will receive the blessings of the new heaven and the new earth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet1:3-1Pet1:5\">1 Peter 1:3–5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:1-Rev21:7\">Revelation 21:1–7</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:3\">Genesis 12:1–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen13:14-Gen13:17\">13:14–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev26:1-Lev26:46\">Leviticus 26:1–46</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut28:1-Deut28:68\">Deuteronomy 28:1–68</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:29-1Kgs8:51\">1 Kings 8:29–51</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:3-1Kgs9:9\">9:3–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:18-2Kgs17:23\">2 Kings 17:18–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps24:1\">Psalms 24:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps89:11\">89:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet1:4\">1 Peter 1:4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:1-Rev21:7\">Revelation 21:1–7</a></p>",
