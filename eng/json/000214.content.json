    "content": "<p>The story of the creation of the universe is key to the Bible&apos;s message. Understanding the first chapters of the book of Genesis is important for developing a biblical perspective of the world (worldview).</p><p>The opening chapters of the Bible address key questions: Who created the world, and why? Why is the world as it is now? Genesis answers these questions. It counters the idol worship that Israel learned from their pagan rulers in Egypt. </p><p>In the promised land, the Israelites would again be close to people who trusted in false gods and worshiped created things instead of the creator. Genesis taught Israel that the one true God created everything and has complete authority over all things. He alone deserves worship.</p><p>God changed chaos and made it the orderly universe we see today. In the first three days, he shaped the formless void into the structured universe. He created the heavens, water and sky, and the earth. In the next three days, he filled each area with life. On the seventh day, God&apos;s day of rest, he set a weekly pattern for human activity. This rest also points to the future spiritual rest God promised to those who trust in him (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb3:7-Heb4:11\">Hebrews 3:7–4:11</a>).</p><p>The creation story teaches that when God finished the creation, it was &quot;very good&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen1:31\">Genesis 1:31</a>). In this setting, humans had a perfect relationship with their creator until they sinned and violated that bond. This rebellion against God introduced evil into human souls (see chapters <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen3:1-Gen6:22\">3–6</a>). The world&apos;s evil does not result from a flaw in creation. Instead, it comes from rebelling against God&apos;s design and purposes.</p><p>Since the first rebellion, humans have separated themselves from the creator. They often do not acknowledge his presence and authority. </p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen3:7-Gen3:19\">Genesis 3:7–19 </a>shows what this separation causes:</p><ul><li><p>shame,</p></li><li><p>failed relationships with God and others,</p></li><li><p>disconnection from the rest of creation, and</p></li><li><p>death.</p></li></ul><p>Since then, God has actively worked in history to restore humans to a relationship with him through Jesus Christ. Restored humans become a new creation (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal6:15\">Galatians 6:15</a>). Through Jesus, eternal life is available to everyone. God will renew everything one day (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa65:17-Isa65:25\">Isaiah 65:17–25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:19-Rom8:22\">Romans 8:19–22</a>). The entire universe will be made new (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:1\">Revelation 21:1</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen1:1-Gen2:3\">Genesis 1:1–2:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps33:6-Ps33:9\">Psalm 33:6–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov3:19\">Proverbs 3:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Prov8:22-Prov8:31\">8:22–31</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa40:26-Isa40:28\">Isaiah 40:26–28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa45:11-Isa45:12\">45:11–12</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa45:18-Isa45:19\">18–19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer10:11-Jer10:16\">Jeremiah 10:11–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John1:1-John1:4\">John 1:1–4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom8:18-Rom8:25\">Romans 8:18–25</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor5:17\">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col1:15-Col1:20\">Colossians 1:15–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev4:11\">Revelation 4:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:1-Rev21:5\">21:1–5</a></p>",
