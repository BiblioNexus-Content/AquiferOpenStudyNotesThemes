    "content": "<p>Jesus promised his followers that he would return to bring them to be with him forever (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John14:1-John14:3\">John 14:1–3</a>). Right after Jesus ascended to heaven, the apostles received a message that he would come back one day (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:9-Acts1:11\">Acts 1:9–11</a>). In the visions described in the book of Revelation, John hears Jesus promise to return again (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev22:6-Rev22:20\">Revelation 22:6–20</a>).</p><p>The final completion of everything, “the Day of the Lord” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess2:2\">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>), will come as a surprise, &quot;like a thief in the night” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess5:2\">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>). Jesus said &quot;only the Father&quot; knows when that day will be (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt24:36\">Matthew 24:36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:6-Acts1:7\">Acts 1:6–7</a>). Now is a time for hope and confidence, not guessing. Christians should not set dates and times for the end. </p><p>When the Bible teaches about future events (what will happen at the end of time), it gives us two important things: hope during difficult times and wisdom for how to live now. The Bible&apos;s teaching about the end times, also called eschatology (the study of what will happen in the future), helps us focus on living faithfully today. Instead of worrying about exactly when these events will occur, we should concentrate on how we live now.</p><p>The apostle Paul describes events like &quot;the rebellion&quot; and the appearance of &quot;the man of lawlessness&quot; that will happen before &quot;the Day of the Lord&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess2:1-2Thess2:12\">2 Thessalonians 2:1–12</a>). Yet, he does not focus on the details. Instead, he reminds his audience of these events to refute false teachings and encourage Christians who suffer for the faith (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess1:3-2Thess1:10\">2 Thessalonians 1:3–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess2:5\">2:5</a>).</p><p>When Christ returns, he will:</p><ul><li><p>defeat the enemies of the good news about Jesus (the gospel)</p></li><li><p>save suffering Christians (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess1:7-2Thess1:10\">2 Thessalonians 1:7–10</a>)</p></li><li><p>gather his followers to be with him forever (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess4:13-1Thess4:17\">1 Thessalonians 4:13–17</a>)</p></li></ul><p>This future event requires a response now. Those who accept the good news and live for God can be confident of rescue. Those who reject God will experience eternal destruction. God&apos;s choice and calling of Christians is their hope and comfort (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess2:13-2Thess2:14\">2 Thessalonians 2:13–14</a>). They can remain steady now as they look to the future (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess2:14-2Thess2:15\">2:14–15</a>). They have a guarantee of the outcome when he returns.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt25:1-Matt25:46\">Matthew 25:1–46</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts1:6-Acts1:7\">Acts 1:6–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess4:13-1Thess5:11\">1 Thessalonians 4:13–5:11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess1:7-2Thess1:10\">2 Thessalonians 1:7–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess2:1-2Thess2:12\">2 Thessalonians 2:1–12</a></p>",
