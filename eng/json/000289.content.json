    "content": "<p>Violation of the sacred is the act of disrespecting, damaging, or misusing something that is considered holy or set apart for God. Ever since the early days in the garden of Eden, humans have tried to claim God&apos;s holy space as their own (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen2:15-Gen2:17\">Genesis 2:15–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen3:1-Gen3:6\">3:1–6</a>). </p><p>The Bible shows God&apos;s anger and quick punishment when people fail to respect his holy commands. God called Nadab and Abihu to lead Israel in proper worship. When they ignored God&apos;s specific instructions about priestly duties, they died for their sin (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev10:1-Lev10:20\">Leviticus 10:1–20</a>). Jesus showed God&apos;s righteous anger when he entered the temple with a whip. He chased out the merchants and money changers who were polluting the holy space for profit (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/John2:13-John2:16\">John 2:13–16</a>).</p><p>No one could violate God&apos;s holy presence, including in the temple in Jerusalem. The temple represented God&apos;s presence in the world, so all its ceremonies had to show its holy status. Only those anointed for the task could enter to make offerings.</p><p>One serious mistake was when King Uzziah &quot;<span>entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense&quot;</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr26:16\">2 Chronicles 26:16</a>). Unlike kings from other ancient Near Eastern cultures, Israel&apos;s kings could not enter the holy space. God anointed them only for government duties. The king of Israel was not a priest nor could he represent God in holy matters. He was not a god, unlike in other cultures. </p><p>He was a servant of God chosen from his people for &quot;carefully observing&quot; the covenant in the community (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut17:18-Deut17:20\">Deuteronomy 17:18–20</a>). When King Uzziah tried to act in a priestly role that did not belong to him, he violated the holy place set apart for God&apos;s presence. This violation was a serious matter related to the function of the temple.</p><p>King David shows humility compared to Uzziah&apos;s pride (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam21:1-1Sam21:9\">1 Samuel 21:1–9</a>). When his men were hungry, David knew there was bread at the tabernacle. Instead of taking it, he asked the priest, who gave them the holy bread with his blessing. </p><p>In contrast, Uzziah entered the temple and showed no respect for this holy space (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr26:16\">26:16</a>). He thought that, as king, he could enter God&apos;s temple. Yet, he did not have that right. God punished him with a skin disease and separation from daily life. This punishment matched the pride of his actions.</p><p>The temptation to act like Uzziah, who showed no respect for holy things, is always present. Any action that fails to honor God, shows no respect for his holy space. Human history is about God restoring the heavens and earth to be his home. </p><p>In the new covenant through Jesus Christ, God&apos;s holy space is not just a temple in Jerusalem or any building. He sets apart the lives of those who trust him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:19-1Cor6:20\">1 Corinthians 6:19–20</a>). Through his grace, God makes the people of the new covenant his temple on earth (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet2:4-1Pet2:5\">1 Peter 2:4–5</a>). They become the place where his holiness enters creation. History will be complete when all of heaven and earth become God&apos;s temple (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa65:17-Isa65:18\">Isaiah 65:17–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:1-Rev21:2\">Revelation 21:1–2</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen2:15-Gen2:17\">Genesis 2:15–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen3:1-Gen3:6\">3:1–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod19:12-Exod19:13\">Exodus 19:12–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod31:14-Exod31:15\">31:14–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev10:1-Lev10:20\">Leviticus 10:1–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev24:16-Lev24:17\">24:16–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num1:51\">Numbers 1:51</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num15:32-Num15:36\">15:32–36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr26:16-2Chr26:21\">2 Chronicles 26:16–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor6:19-1Cor6:20\">1 Corinthians 6:19–20</a></p>",
