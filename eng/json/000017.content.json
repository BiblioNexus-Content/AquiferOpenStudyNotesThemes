    "content": "<p>At the end of God&apos;s work of creation, God said that everything he made was &quot;very good&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen1:31\">Genesis 1:31</a>). Scripture often considers the beauty and wonder of God&apos;s creation, especially in the psalms (see, for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps8:3-Ps8:4\">Psalm 8:3–4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps104:1-Ps104:35\">Psalm 104:1–35</a>).</p><p>Nature and imagery from nature are important in the Song of Solomons (or Song of Songs). The man and woman often express their love in the countryside (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song2:8-Song2:17\">Song of Solomon 2:8–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song4:12-Song5:1\">4:12–5:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song6:2-Song6:3\">6:2–3</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song6:11-Song6:12\">11–12</a>). This is a place with pleasant smells and private spots. The garden, vineyard, and orchard create intimate and romantic settings. The mystery of nature gives them a simple, yet unfamiliar and exciting, scene for their love. </p><p>The couple uses many nature metaphors to describe each other&apos;s physical features and their exciting effects. Their descriptions of each other lead them to use illustrations from God’s creation.</p><p>Nature directs people to the creator, showing evidence of his power, goodness, justice, and love (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps19:1-Ps19:4\">Psalm 19:1–4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom1:18-Rom1:20\">Romans 1:18–20</a>). God&apos;s desire for redemption, restoration, and new creation is also evident in nature&apos;s beauty. Examples include the changing seasons, plant growth, and the birth of children.</p><p><u>Sections for Additional Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen2:1-Gen2:9\">Genesis 2:1–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps8:3-Ps8:8\">Psalms 8:3–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps19:1-Ps19:6\">19:1–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps96:5-Ps96:6\">96:5–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song2:8-Song2:17\">Song of Solomon 2:8–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song4:12-Song5:1\">4:12–5:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song6:2-Song6:3\">6:2–3</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song6:11-Song6:12\">11–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Song7:10-Song7:13\">7:10–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt6:26-Matt6:30\">Matthew 6:26–30</a></p>",
