    "content": "<p>For the Pharisees and other practicing Jews, eating meals together was a religious event. Righteous Jews followed many rules to avoid ceremonial pollution during meals. They did this to show their commitment to the law, not to exclude others.</p><p>Most Jews obeyed the food laws most of the time. Jesus did as well. Yet, he often ate with people on purpose who were ceremonially unclean or less committed to obeying the law. Sharing a meal could show both covenantal and social equality (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:26-Matt26:29\">Matthew 26:26–29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:27-2Kgs25:30\">2 Kings 25:27–30</a>). The Pharisees believed that avoiding such sinners was necessary for righteousness. This is why it offended them when Jesus ate with sinners (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt9:10-Matt9:11\">Matthew 9:10–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt11:19\">11:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt21:28-Matt21:32\">21:28–32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke7:36-Luke7:50\">Luke 7:36–50</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke15:1-Luke15:2\">15:1–2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke19:1-Luke19:10\">19:1–10</a>).</p><p>Jesus shared meals with sinful people to show God&apos;s grace. He extended God&apos;s love and forgiveness, inviting everyone to join a new community. Jesus&apos;s last meal (called &quot;the Last Supper&quot;) anticipates the feast in the kingdom of heaven (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:29\">Matthew 26:29</a>; see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt8:11-Matt8:12\">8:11–12</a>). In the early church, communal meals also played an important role. They expressed communion among Christians and were an opportunity to partake of the Lord&apos;s Supper (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts2:46\">Acts 2:46</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor11:17-1Cor11:34\">1 Corinthians 11:17–34</a>).</p><p>The apostle Paul continued Jesus&apos;s practice to create a bond between Jews and gentiles (people who are not Jewish) in the church (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal2:11-Gal2:21\">Galatians 2:11–21</a>). Jesus tore &quot;<span>down the dividing wall of hostility&quot; between Jews and gentiles </span>(<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph2:14-Eph2:18\">Ephesians 2:14–18</a>). He calls us to community with all his people.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen18:1-Gen18:8\">Genesis 18:1–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod24:9-Exod24:11\">Exodus 24:9–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:27-2Kgs25:30\">2 Kings 25:27–30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt8:11-Matt8:12\">Matthew 8:11–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt9:10-Matt9:13\">9:10–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt11:19\">11:19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt26:26-Matt26:29\">26:26–29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke7:36-Luke7:50\">Luke 7:36–50</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke15:1-Luke15:2\">15:1–2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke19:1-Luke19:10\">19:1–10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke22:14-Luke22:21\">22:14–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts2:46-Acts2:47\">Acts 2:46–47</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor11:20-1Cor11:34\">1 Corinthians 11:20–34</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal2:11-Gal2:16\">Galatians 2:11–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph2:14-Eph2:18\">Ephesians 2:14–18</a></p>",
