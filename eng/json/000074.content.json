    "content": "<p>Holiness is one main way to describe God. It is not just one of his many traits, it is central to who he is. Calling God “the Holy One” emphasizes how he is completely different than anyone or anything else. Creation exists within the limits of time, but nothing limits God. </p><p>God calls himself, “<span>I AM WHO I AM</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:14\">Exodus 3:14</a>). This means he defines himself by himself. God is entirely different, completely self-sufficient, and separate from what he created.</p><p>God&apos;s holiness also refers to his character. People often describe God&apos;s holiness as his separation from sin and his anger against it. Yet, holiness includes all aspects of God&apos;s character, such as his mercy. God revealed himself to Moses as the &quot;God of compassion and mercy.&quot; He is, &quot;slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion and faithfulness, maintaining loving devotion to a thousand generations, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin. Yet He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod34:6-Exod34:7\">Exodus 34:6–7</a>).</p><p>God&apos;s holiness can be dangerous to those who approach without permission and respect (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa6:3\">Isaiah 6:3</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa6:5\">5</a>; see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod28:35\">Exodus 28:35</a>). His endless holiness is overwhelming for imperfect humans. It would completely destroy them without God&apos;s mercy. </p><p>When we understand God&apos;s holiness, it should fill us with deep respect and wonder. We must not treat God&apos;s holiness casually or without proper honor. This might have been the mistake that led to Nadab and Abihu&apos;s deaths (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev10:1-Lev10:3\">Leviticus 10:1–3</a>). Only by recognizing the awesomeness of God can we truly appreciate his love for us and worship him rightly and sincerely.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod3:14\">Exodus 3:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod34:6-Exod34:7\">34:6–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev10:3\">Leviticus 10:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev11:44-Lev11:45\">Leviticus 11:44–45</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam2:1-1Sam2:2\">1 Samuel 2:1–2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa6:3-Isa6:5\">Isaiah 6:3–5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa52:10\">52:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Hos11:9\">Hosea 11:9</a></p>",
