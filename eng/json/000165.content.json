    "content": "<p>The wall of Jerusalem held great political, social, and religious importance for the people of Judah (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh2:10\">Nehemiah 2:10</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh2:19\">19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh4:1-Neh4:15\">4:1–15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh6:1-Neh6:14\">6:1–14</a>). In ancient and even modern times, a city without walls cannot last long. Walls protected cities from invading armies and common criminals. </p><p>By Nehemiah’s time, Jerusalem&apos;s walls had been in ruins for over a hundred years, since the city&apos;s destruction in 586 BC. The ruined wall was a shameful reminder that God had punished the city, fulfilling the covenant curses due to the people&apos;s sins (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh1:2-Neh1:7\">Nehemiah 1:2–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh2:17\">2:17</a>). Rebuilding the wall would show God&apos;s blessing and prove that he was restoring the covenant people. Israel’s enemies knew that if they rebuilt the wall, the Jews would gain political power, security, and self-rule. Therefore, they strongly opposed the rebuilding.</p><p>Under Nehemiah&apos;s leadership, the people of Judea rebuilt the entire wall in just fifty-two days during the fall of 445 BC. This quick and successful reconstruction can encourage Christians that with God&apos;s help, they can achieve remarkable things (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh2:18\">Nehemiah 2:18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh4:14-Neh4:15\">4:14–15</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh4:20\">20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh6:16\">6:16</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh1:2-Neh1:4\">Nehemiah 1:2–4</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh2:10-Neh2:20\">2:10–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh3:1-Neh3:32\">3:1–32</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh4:1-Neh4:23\">4:1–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh6:1-Neh6:16\">6:1–16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps51:16-Ps51:18\">Psalm 51:16–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa22:5\">Isaiah 22:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Isa26:1-Isa26:3\">26:1–3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rev21:10-Rev21:27\">Revelation 21:10–27</a></p>",
