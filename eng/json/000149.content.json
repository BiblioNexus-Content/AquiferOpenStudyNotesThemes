    "content": "<p>The role of a Christian leader is to serve and endure difficulties for those they guide (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mark10:35-Mark10:45\">Mark 10:35–45</a>). For the apostle Paul, good leadership meant setting an example like Jesus Christ. Jesus&apos;s death on the cross was the most important thing to Paul, and it completely shaped how he lived his life. He said, “<span>I want to know … the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to Him in His death</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil3:10\">Philippians 3:10</a>; see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col1:24\">Colossians 1:24</a>). </p><p>He meant more than emotional struggles or dealing with sin. He meant experiencing violent physical suffering. Paul endured difficulties for those with whom he shared the good news. He always made their salvation a priority over his own safety (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:10\">2 Timothy 2:10</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor4:8-2Cor4:12\">2 Corinthians 4:8–12</a>). </p><p>A Christian leader&apos;s life shows others about Jesus&apos; death on the cross. It shows how God works powerfully even through weak human beings (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor12:8-2Cor12:10\">2 Corinthians 12:8–10</a>). It also shows God’s wisdom despite human foolishness (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor1:18-1Cor1:31\">1 Corinthians 1:18–31</a>). When Paul called the apostle Timothy to lead, he also called him to &quot;endure hardship&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:1-2Tim4:5\">2 Timothy 4:1–5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:8\">1:8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:3\">2:3</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:5\">4:5</a>). Paul told Timothy not to be ashamed of the cross (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:8\">1:8</a>).</p><p>True Christian leadership must follow Jesus Christ&apos;s example of putting others first. When leaders focus on themselves instead of Christ, they fail to live out the good news of Jesus. A good leader follows Jesus&apos;s example by serving and caring for others, not seeking their own benefit (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Phil2:3-Phil2:8\">Philippians 2:3–8</a>). These leaders are ready to experience difficult times. They know that those who share in Jesus&apos; death will also share in his life, and those who remain faithful through difficulties will share in his rule (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:11-2Tim2:12\">2 Timothy 2:11–12</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/John13:15\">John 13:15</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts20:35\">Acts 20:35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Cor4:8-2Cor4:12\">2 Corinthians 4:8–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Eph5:2\">Ephesians 5:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Col1:24\">Colossians 1:24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Thess1:6-1Thess1:7\">1 Thessalonians 1:6–7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Thess3:9\">2 Thessalonians 3:9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim1:16\">1 Timothy 1:16</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Tim4:12\">4:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:8\">2 Timothy 1:8</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim1:12\">12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:3\">2:3</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim2:10-2Tim2:12\">10–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Tim4:1-2Tim4:5\">4:1–5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Titus2:7\">Titus 2:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb6:12\">Hebrews 6:12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb13:7\">13:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet2:21\">1 Peter 2:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Pet5:1-1Pet5:4\">5:1–4</a></p>",
