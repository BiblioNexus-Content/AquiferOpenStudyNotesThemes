    "content": "<p>The earliest people who moved from place to place (called nomads) made music. The first musician mentioned in the Bible is &quot;Jubal,&quot; who played the harp and flute (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen4:21\">Genesis 4:21</a>). </p><p>Music was important from the beginning of Israel&apos;s worship in the tabernacle. In <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod28:34-Exod28:35\">Exodus 28:34–35</a>, Aaron&apos;s robe had bells on the lower hem that sounded as he entered the holy place. Scripture records several songs created by God&apos;s people (for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod15:1-Exod15:21\">Exodus 15:1–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut31:30-Deut32:44\">Deuteronomy 31:30–32:44</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg5:1-Judg5:31\">Judges 5:1–31</a>).</p><p>The first liturgical music in the Old Testament appears during the transfer of the ark of the covenant. King David and the Israelites sang, played instruments, and danced to honor the Lord (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam6:5\">2 Samuel 6:5</a>). David is famous for creating the musical instruments used in the temple (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr7:6\">2 Chronicles 7:6</a>). In the time after the exile (when the people of Israel returned from being captives in Babylon), the singers from the tribe of Levi were descendants of Asaph. Asaph was the chief musician appointed by David (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezra2:41\">Ezra 2:41</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh7:44\">Nehemiah 7:44</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Neh11:22-Neh11:23\">11:22–23</a>). In simple terms, Israel&apos;s worship music and how it was organized began during the time of David.</p><p>The formal ceremonies in Solomon&apos;s Temple were different from the excited and spontaneous worship of David&apos;s time (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr7:1-2Chr7:6\">2 Chronicles 7:1–6</a>). Singers and musicians for temple worship were chosen from the tribe of Levi (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr25:1\">1 Chronicles 25:1</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr25:7\">7</a>). These musicians took turns participating in services held on weekdays, Sabbaths, and special holy days.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen4:21\">Genesis 4:21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod28:34-Exod28:35\">Exodus 28:34–35</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam6:5\">2 Samuel 6:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Chr7:6\">2 Chronicles 7:6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ps71:22-Ps71:23\">Psalm 71:22–23</a></p>",
