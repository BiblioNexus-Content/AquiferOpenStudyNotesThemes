    "content": "<p>Sometimes God asks people to share the good news about Jesus with a difficult audience. The listeners might resist God&apos;s truth and reject both the message and the messenger. This was especially true for the Old Testament prophets, who often shared messages that people did not want to hear (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer26:7-Jer26:9\">Jeremiah 26:7–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer38:1-Jer38:6\">38:1–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos7:10-Amos7:13\">Amos 7:10–13</a>).</p><p>The prophet Malachi preached to a difficult audience. His congregation included people who were: </p><ul><li><p>disappointed (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal1:2\">Malachi 1:2</a>)</p></li><li><p>distrusting (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal1:7\">1:7</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal2:2\">2:2</a>)</p></li><li><p>uncaring (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal2:13-Mal2:16\">2:13–16</a>)</p></li><li><p>dishonest (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal3:5\">3:5</a>)</p></li><li><p>disinterested (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal3:14-Mal3:15\">3:14–15</a>)</p></li><li><p>doubting, skeptical, and the truly wicked (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal4:1\">4:1</a>) </p></li></ul><p>What should a preacher say to such a group?</p><p>Malachi used conversation to engage his audience in a series of debates. The prophet gave a strong correction that cleverly answered the objections people might raise before they could speak. His message was powerful and made people pay attention: “<span>those who feared the LORD spoke with one another, and the LORD listened and heard them</span>” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal3:16\">Malachi 3:16</a>).</p><p>Like the prophets, both Jesus and his followers shared messages with audiences who resisted them (see, for example, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Luke4:16-Luke4:30\">Luke 4:16–30</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John10:22-John10:40\">John 10:22–40</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts5:26-Acts5:40\">Acts 5:26–40</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts22:30-Acts23:10\">22:30–23:10</a>). Yet, this resistance did not stop them from fulfilling their God-given duty to share the good news about Jesus (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts5:41-Acts5:42\">Acts 5:41–42</a>). Those who preach the Lord&apos;s message can hope for a positive response like Malachi did. But, that is not always guaranteed.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gen19:6-Gen19:11\">Genesis 19:6–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod17:1-Exod17:13\">Exodus 17:1–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg9:1-Judg9:21\">Judges 9:1–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:8-1Kgs22:28\">1 Kings 22:8–28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer28:1-Jer28:17\">Jeremiah 28:1–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Mal3:14-Mal3:18\">Malachi 3:14–18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John10:24-John10:39\">John 10:24–39</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Acts22:30-Acts23:10\">Acts 22:30–23:10</a></p>",
