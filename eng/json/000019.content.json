    "content": "<p>Biblical law is more than lists of rules. It is a system of what God expects about belief and behavior. If people follow it faithfully, they will receive God&apos;s greatest blessings. Keeping the law is essential for life (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut4:1\">Deuteronomy 4:1</a>; see also <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut5:32-Deut5:33\">5:32–33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut8:1\">8:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut16:20\">16:20</a>).</p><p>Israel&apos;s journey out of Egypt freed them to serve God. God rescued Israel &quot;by a <span>strong hand and an outstretched arm, and by great terrors</span>&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut4:34\">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>). This was not because Israel deserved it. But it was because God is gracious and keeps his promises to Abraham. The rescue from Egypt was not only to free the Israelites from hard labor (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod1:11-Exod1:22\">Exodus 1:11–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod5:4-Exod5:23\">5:4–23</a>). But it was also to make a covenant (special agreement) with them. </p><p>This covenant did not make the Israelites God&apos;s people. They already were his people (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod4:22-Exod4:23\">Exodus 4:22–23</a>). Obedience was not a requirement before the covenant. Instead, it was the right response to the covenant. It gave Israel the duty to serve God as &quot;<span>a kingdom of priests and a holy nation&quot;</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod19:4-Exod19:6\">Exodus 19:4–6</a>). God gave the law to guide Israel as a nation so that God&apos;s people would display his unfailing love and faithfulness.</p><p>The covenant promised the people of Israel a good and meaningful life if they followed the law. The covenant document includes broad principles, patterns, and standards. God&apos;s instructions are best known in the Ten Commandments (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut5:6-Deut5:21\">Deuteronomy 5:6–21</a>). This is shown most briefly in the Jewish prayer called the <em>Shema</em> (a Hebrew word meaning &quot;<span>hear&quot;). This prayer is found in </span><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut6:4-Deut6:5\">Deuteronomy 6:4–5</a>. All other laws of God interpret and apply these main principles.</p><p>The life that came from following the law was not eternal life as described in the New Testament. God promised that if the Israelites obeyed the covenant, the nation would enjoy long and successful days in the promised land (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut4:1\">Deuteronomy 4:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut5:16\">5:16</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut5:33\">33</a>). Jesus also urged his disciples to follow the Ten Commandments and the demands of the <em>Shema</em> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt22:37-Matt22:40\">Matthew 22:37–40</a>). This was not to gain eternal life but to show their commitment to him (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:17-Matt5:19\">Matthew 5:17–19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John14:15-John14:21\">John 14:15–21</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod19:4-Exod19:6\">Exodus 19:4–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev18:5\">Leviticus 18:5</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut4:1-Deut4:2\">Deuteronomy 4:1–2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut5:6-Deut5:21\">5:6–21</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut5:32-Deut5:33\">32–33</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut6:1-Deut6:9\">6:1–9</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut8:1\">8:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut30:1-Deut30:20\">30:1–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt5:17-Matt5:48\">Matthew 5:17–48</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Matt22:36-Matt22:40\">22:36–40</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/John14:15-John14:21\">John 14:15–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom3:19-Rom3:24\">Romans 3:19–24</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom7:1-Rom7:12\">7:1–12</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Cor9:20-1Cor9:21\">1 Corinthians 9:20–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal3:1-Gal3:22\">Galatians 3:1–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:14\">5:14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb7:18-Heb7:19\">Hebrews 7:18–19</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb10:1\">10:1</a></p>",
