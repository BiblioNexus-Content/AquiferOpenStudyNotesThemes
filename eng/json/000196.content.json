    "content": "<p>The ark of the covenant was a wooden chest covered with gold, located in the Most Holy Place of the Jewish tabernacle, and later the temple. It reminded Israel of God&apos;s covenant with them. Inside were the tablets of the covenant, known as the &quot;Ten Commandments.&quot; On the day of atonement, the high priest sprinkled blood on the ark&apos;s cover to purify the people (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev16:2-Lev16:17\">Leviticus 16:2–17</a>).</p><p>During Israel’s time in the wilderness, God&apos;s glory appeared over the ark, where he met with his people (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod25:22\">Exodus 25:22</a>). Throughout Israel’s history, the ark represented God&apos;s presence. The people carried it as they traveled (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num10:33-Num10:36\">Numbers 10:33–36</a>). When they brought it to the Jordan River, the water stopped so the Israelites could cross on dry ground (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh3:4-Josh3:6\">Joshua 3:4–6</a>). They carried the ark around Jericho before the city was invaded. It was present during the siege of the Ammonite city of Rabbah in King David’s time (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam11:1-2Sam11:11\">2 Samuel 11:1–11</a>).</p><p>The Philistines considered the ark as equal to Israel’s God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam4:6-1Sam4:8\">1 Samuel 4:6–8</a>). This made sense because the Philistines took images of their gods into battle (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam5:21\">2 Samuel 5:21</a>). The Israelites did not use images of God. So they considered the ark as God&apos;s &quot;footstool&quot; and temporary home, not his image (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Chr28:2\">1 Chronicles 28:2</a>). </p><p>Yet, the Israelites developed a false view of the ark. They treated this holy object like a magic box and tried to use God&apos;s presence for their own gain. They thought &quot;<span>it may go with us to save us from the hand of our enemies</span>” (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam4:3\">1 Samuel 4:3</a>). Their defeat that day showed that non one can control God (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam4:1-1Sam4:11\">4:1–11</a>). He is the leader of his people, and they must obey and trust him (compare <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh5:13-Josh5:15\">Joshua 5:13–15</a>).</p><p>King David eventually moved the ark to Jerusalem (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam6:1-2Sam6:17\">2 Samuel 6:1–17</a>). When King Solomon built the temple, he placed the ark in the most holy place. It remained the center of Israelite worship (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:1-1Kgs8:11\">1 Kings 8:1–11</a>). </p><p>The Hebrew scriptures do not mention the ark after the early kingdom or monarchy. It was probably destroyed by the Babylonians along with the temple in 586 BC. Yet, a tradition from the apocrypha (or deuterocanon) claims that the prophet Jeremiah hid the ark during the exile in Babylon (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Macc2:4-2Macc2:8\">2 Maccabees 2:4–8</a>) (The apocrypha is <span>a set of ancient texts not included in the Hebrew Bible but accepted by some Christian groups as Scripture.) </span>Still, God&apos;s presence through Jesus Christ and his complete sacrifice made the ark unnecessary (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb9:1-Heb10:18\">Hebrews 9:1–10:18</a>).</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod25:10-Exod25:22\">Exodus 25:10–22</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Exod40:20-Exod40:21\">40:20–21</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev16:2\">Leviticus 16:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Num10:33-Num10:36\">Numbers 10:33–36</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut31:25-Deut31:26\">Deuteronomy 31:25–26</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh3:4-Josh3:6\">Joshua 3:4–6</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh6:6-Josh6:13\">6:6–13</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg20:26-Judg20:28\">Judges 20:26–28</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam4:3-1Sam4:11\">1 Samuel 4:3–11</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/1Sam5:1-1Sam7:2\">5:1–7:2</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Sam6:1-2Sam6:17\">2 Samuel 6:1–17</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jer3:16-Jer3:18\">Jeremiah 3:16–18</a></p>",
