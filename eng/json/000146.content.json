    "content": "<p>God does not want his people to suffer under oppression. From the time when God freed the Israelites from slavery in Egypt under Moses (the exodus), to when Joshua led them to conquer the promised land, and through David&apos;s battles, God&apos;s goal for Israel was complete victory over their enemies (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Josh1:1-Josh1:9\">Joshua 1:1–9</a>). In a similar way, the New Testament often speaks of freedom from the oppression or control of sin as an essential blessing of a relationship with Jesus (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom6:1-Rom6:14\">Romans 6:1–14</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Gal5:1-Gal5:15\">Galatians 5:1–15</a>).</p><p>Why does oppression exist? The book of Judges suggests it is because of human disobedience. If Israel obeyed God he promised victory in the conquest. Yet, at best they only partially obeyed him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg1:19-Judg1:36\">Judges 1:19–36</a>). With the rewards of victory available, why did God&apos;s past people fail as well as the church today?</p><p>In Judges, a new generation grew up that did not participate in the exodus from Egypt or Joshua&apos;s conquest of Canaan. Their faith relied on stories of divine acts from the past. They had not personally witnessed &quot;<span>all the great works that the LORD had done for Israel&quot;</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg2:7\">Judges 2:7</a>). This generation &quot;<span>did not know the LORD or the works that He had done for Israel&quot;</span> (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg2:10\">2:10</a>). </p><p>God allowed enemies to remain in the land &quot;to test all the Israelites&quot; (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg3:1-Judg3:4\">3:1–4</a>). But Israel did not expel these enemies as God commanded. The rest of the book of Judges shows the tragic results of that failure.</p><p>God allows his people to experience the consequences of turning away from him (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg2:12-Judg2:14\">Judges 2:12–14</a>). But God remains faithful and does not ultimately abandon those who truly worship him. Even in judgment, God punishes for good. He teaches his people obedience. </p><p>The enemies who took Israel&apos;s blessings became part of God&apos;s test of Israel&apos;s faithfulness. We can learn from oppression, as both physical and spiritual battles need discipline. This experience can lead to a &quot;<span>a harvest of righteousness and peace</span>&quot; (see <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Heb12:5-Heb12:11\">Hebrews 12:5–11</a>).</p><p>Through Jesus Christ, God provided undeserved salvation from the worldwide oppression of sin, “while we were still sinners” (<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Rom5:8\">Romans 5:8</a>). The Israelites experienced salvation from their enemies when they turned in repentance to the Lord. So, we can experience salvation from the greatest oppressive force when we turn to God in repentance.</p><p><u>Passages for Further Study</u></p><p><a href=\"https://ref.ly/Lev26:14-Lev26:39\">Leviticus 26:14–39</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut8:19-Deut8:20\">Deuteronomy 8:19–20</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Deut28:15-Deut28:68\">28:15–68</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg2:2-Judg2:3\">Judges 2:2–3</a>, <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg2:10-Judg2:15\">10–15</a>,<a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg2:18\">18</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Judg3:1-Judg3:8\">3:1–8</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:5-2Kgs17:23\">2 Kings 17:5–23</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Ezek22:27-Ezek22:29\">Ezekiel 22:27–29</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Amos4:1\">Amos 4:1</a>; <a href=\"https://ref.ly/Jas2:1-Jas2:7\">James 2:1–7</a></p>",
