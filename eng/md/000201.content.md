## The Central Sanctuary (id: 500192)

God wanted people to worship where he had chosen to put his name. For Israel, this was first the tabernacle and later the temple in Jerusalem.

God is *transcendent* (above all things) and *omnipresent* (present everywhere). Yet he chose a specific place for Israel to worship him. King Solomon later asked how the God of heaven could live in a building made by humans ([1 Kings 8:27](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:27)). The answer is that God's name represents himself.

The tabernacle and later the temple belonged to him and his name marked them. So they were, in a way, his homes. In the ancient Near East, names were more than just labels. They showed the character and nature of the person (for example, Jacob, [Genesis 27:36](https://ref.ly/Gen27:36); Jesus, [Matthew 1:21](https://ref.ly/Matt1:21); Barnabas, [Acts 4:36](https://ref.ly/Acts4:36); Peter, [Matthew 16:17–19](https://ref.ly/Matt16:17-Matt16:19)). Thus, Solomon could advise, “A good name is more desirable than great riches” ([Proverbs 22:1](https://ref.ly/Prov22:1)).

God lived in a holy place that carried his name. His glorious presence appeared as fire and cloud during the time Israel lived in the wilderness. This acted as a constant reminder that he was with his people ([Exodus 40:34–35](https://ref.ly/Exod40:34-Exod40:35)). Similarly, when Solomon established the temple, God's presence was also evident ([1 Kings 8:10–11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:10-1Kgs8:11)).

God later lived among his people as Jesus Christ ([John 1:14](https://ref.ly/John1:14)). This removed the need for a central holy place (see [John 4:19–24](https://ref.ly/John4:19-John4:24)). Now, because the Holy Spirit lives within them, all Christians can "house" God's presence ([1 Corinthians 3:16–17](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:16-1Cor3:17); [6:19–20](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:19-1Cor6:20); [2 Corinthians 6:16](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:16); [Ephesians 2:21](https://ref.ly/Eph2:21)).
