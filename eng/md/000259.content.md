## The Resurrection of the Dead (id: 500405)

Jesus spoke about a future resurrection for everyone. God will raise up all people to eternal life or to judgment ([Mark 12:26–27](https://ref.ly/Mark12:26-Mark12:27); [John 5:28–29](https://ref.ly/John5:28-John5:29); [6:39–40](https://ref.ly/John6:39-John6:40), [44](https://ref.ly/John6:44), [54](https://ref.ly/John6:54); [11:25–26](https://ref.ly/John11:25-John11:26); see also [Luke 20:34–36](https://ref.ly/Luke20:34-Luke20:36)). When Jesus returns, all his followers will resurrect to be with him forever ([1 Thessalonians 4:13–18](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:13-1Thess4:18); see also [2 Corinthians 5:1–10](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:1-2Cor5:10)).

This strong hope defined the perspective of early Christians. They endured suffering by focusing on the life to come ([2 Corinthians 4:16–18](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:16-2Cor4:18); compare [Hebrews 12:2](https://ref.ly/Heb12:2)). They expected Jesus to return, resurrect their bodies, and anticipated living with him forever ([1 Peter 1:3–6](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:3-1Pet1:6), [23](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:23)). They based their faith on the foundation of Jesus’ own bodily resurrection ([1 Corinthians 15:12–20](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:12-1Cor15:20); [Acts 4:33](https://ref.ly/Acts4:33); see also [2 Corinthians 4:14](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:14)).

Resurrection bodies will be very different from the bodies we have now, which have limits and weaknesses. These new bodies will be like Christ's own resurrection body: glorious, strong, never dying, and spiritual ([1 Corinthians 15:35–58](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:35-1Cor15:58)).

Christians are already united to Christ, so they begin experiencing resurrection life now. They "were raised" with Christ and are "alive to God in Christ Jesus" ([Romans 6:4–11](https://ref.ly/Rom6:4-Rom6:11); [8:10–11](https://ref.ly/Rom8:10-Rom8:11); [Colossians 2:12](https://ref.ly/Col2:12)). Their lives now focus on spiritual realities of heaven, not worldly things ([Colossians 3:1–4](https://ref.ly/Col3:1-Col3:4)). Christians can experience the transforming power of this new life, which frees them from sin and death ([Romans 8:1–4](https://ref.ly/Rom8:1-Rom8:4)). In all challenges, they trust in God's resurrection power, not themselves ([2 Corinthians 1:9](https://ref.ly/2Cor1:9)).
