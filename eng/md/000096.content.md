## God’s Promised Kingdom (id: 500232)

God promised that his kingdom would come through King David ([1 Chronicles 17:4–14](https://ref.ly/1Chr17:4-1Chr17:14)). During his rule, David prepared for building the temple, which would be the center of God's kingdom ([28:11–19](https://ref.ly/1Chr28:11-1Chr28:19)). He urged Israel's leaders to "keep and seek out all the commandments of the LORD" ([28:8–10](https://ref.ly/1Chr28:8-1Chr28:10)). He encouraged the community of Israel to be strong and brave in trusting God to provide ([28:20–21](https://ref.ly/1Chr28:20-1Chr28:21)).

The writer of the Chronicles used King David's words to encourage the people of Judea after the Israelite exile. He urged them to keep trusting that God would restore the kingdom. He wanted them to know that God's promise to David, later confirmed to King Solomon, was also true for them. 

After the exile, Judah was no longer an independent kingdom ruled by David's family. Instead, Judea was a small area with limited freedom under the control of a Persian governor. Still, the people of Judea could receive God's blessings, just like during the times of kings Hezekiah and Josiah. The writer of the Chronicles did not know exactly how God's promise to David would come true. Yet, he fully trusted in God's power, sovereign control, and justice. He believed that God would keep his promise and that his kingdom would eventually rule over all.

After the time of the writer of the Chronicles, the people became discouraged. The Greeks took control of Israel from the Persians. The Greek rulers were not friendly to the Jewish people and their beliefs. One Greek ruler, Antiochus IV (who called himself "Epiphanes"), was especially cruel during his rule from 175 to 163 BC. He tried very hard to destroy the Jewish faith and way of life. The prophet Daniel had predicted this would happen ([Daniel 11:21–39](https://ref.ly/Dan11:21-Dan11:39)). 

The priestly family of the Maccabees resisted Antiochus, restored the temple, and preserved Judea's identity. Yet, the community became disunited under the Maccabees' successors. Israel divided into groups like the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes. Eventually, the Romans controlled them. When Jesus was born, Roman governors ruled Israel.

God's promises to David came true in an unexpected way. Jesus was the anointed king (the Christ or Messiah) from David's line. He established his Kingdom not by defeating the Romans in battle but by defeating the power of sin and death. His kingdom expands through his followers, and hell's powers will never conquer it. Ultimately, his kingdom will fully triumph over evil, and he will rule as king forever (see [Revelation 19:11–20:15](https://ref.ly/Rev19:11-Rev20:15)).
