## Blessing (id: 500163)

Before the patriarch Jacob died, he blessed each of his sons and Joseph's sons ([Genesis 49:1–28](https://ref.ly/Gen49:1-Gen49:28); [48:3–20](https://ref.ly/Gen48:3-Gen48:20)). This was also how his father Isaac had blessed him ([27:27–29](https://ref.ly/Gen27:27-Gen27:29)). A blessing gives, improves, and enriches life, while a curse harms it ([Leviticus 26:14–39](https://ref.ly/Lev26:14-Lev26:39)). A benefactor (a person who gives help) gives a blessing publicly, providing power for prosperity and success. 

Blessings are essential in covenant relationships. This is because they guide and motivate people to follow the covenant's rules ([Leviticus 26:3–13](https://ref.ly/Lev26:3-Lev26:13)). Obedience leads to blessings, while rebellion results in a curse (see [Deuteronomy 28](https://ref.ly/Deut28:1-Deut28:68)).

The first area of blessing is creation. God, as creator, gives blessings to animals and humans ([Genesis 1:22](https://ref.ly/Gen1:22); [1:28](https://ref.ly/Gen1:28); see [Psalms 104](https://ref.ly/Ps104:1-Ps104:35); [128:3–4](https://ref.ly/Ps128:3-Ps128:4)). God also uses humans also to give divine blessings. God chose Abraham to bless the nations ([Genesis 12:2–3](https://ref.ly/Gen12:2-Gen12:3)). God supports and purifies the family, government, and religion through blessings ([27:27–29](https://ref.ly/Gen27:27-Gen27:29); [14:19](https://ref.ly/Gen14:19); [1 Kings 8:14](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:14), [52](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:52), [66](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:66); [Leviticus 9:22](https://ref.ly/Lev9:22)). Israel’s priests passed on God’s blessing to Israel ([Numbers 6:24–26](https://ref.ly/Num6:24-Num6:26); [Deuteronomy 10:8](https://ref.ly/Deut10:8)).

Old Testament blessings have three main aspects:

1. A greater group gives them to a lesser one ([Genesis 32:26](https://ref.ly/Gen32:26); [Hebrews 7:6–7](https://ref.ly/Heb7:6-Heb7:7)).
2. They show favor, leading to well\-being and success ([Deuteronomy 28:3–7](https://ref.ly/Deut28:3-Deut28:7)).
3. They recognize that all power and blessings come from the creator. God's love is the source of all blessings ([Deuteronomy 7:7–8](https://ref.ly/Deut7:7-Deut7:8), [12–15](https://ref.ly/Deut7:12-Deut7:15)).

God's blessings in the Old Testament are very different from those in ancient pagan religions. In pagan religions, people believed that wealth and fertility in family, animals, and crops came through "sympathetic" magical ceremonies (special religious rituals) at their worship places. These ceremonies intended to influence the gods to maintain the cycle of life. In the Old Testament, all life, fertility, and blessings came from God's command, as he is the only true and living God.

In the New Testament, blessings focus more on spiritual matters than material ones. They shift from the Israelite nation to the church and from temporary to eternal ([Matthew 6:25](https://ref.ly/Matt6:25); [Ephesians 1:3](https://ref.ly/Eph1:3); [1 Peter 3:9](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:9)). Through his death, Jesus took on the consequences of sin's curse ([Galatians 3:13](https://ref.ly/Gal3:13)). He established God's kingdom ([Matthew 3:2](https://ref.ly/Matt3:2); [5:3–20](https://ref.ly/Matt5:3-Matt5:20); [John 3:3–5](https://ref.ly/John3:3-John3:5)). He gave forgiveness of sin to its citizens ([Romans 4:6–25](https://ref.ly/Rom4:6-Rom4:25)). Now, God calls Christians to bless the world ([Luke 6:27–28](https://ref.ly/Luke6:27-Luke6:28); [Romans 12:14](https://ref.ly/Rom12:14); see also [Isaiah 19:24](https://ref.ly/Isa19:24); [Zechariah 8:13](https://ref.ly/Zech8:13)).
