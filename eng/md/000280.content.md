## The Worship of Angels (id: 500448)

Scripture often describes angels as beings that inspire awe or fear (for example, [Joshua 5:13–15](https://ref.ly/Josh5:13-Josh5:15); [Luke 2:8–10](https://ref.ly/Luke2:8-Luke2:10)). Yet, angels serve God and he does not allow people to worship them ([Hebrews 1:5–14](https://ref.ly/Heb1:5-Heb1:14); [Revelation 19:10](https://ref.ly/Rev19:10)). Jewish tradition developed the idea of angels as mediators (those who connect others to God). In pre\-Christian Judaism, people emphasized God's *transcendence* or "otherness" so much that they believed mediators were necessary to communicate with him. In this context, angels became more important.

For Christians, Jesus has a unique role as mediator between God and humans. Focusing on angels or deceased saints as ways to communicate with God can distract from honoring Jesus as the only necessary mediator ([1 Timothy 2:5–6](https://ref.ly/1Tim2:5-1Tim2:6); see also [2 Corinthians 5:19–21](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:19-2Cor5:21); [Hebrews 7:24–25](https://ref.ly/Heb7:24-Heb7:25)). God still uses angelic messengers, but they are creatures serving him, not divine beings to worship. Only God deserves our prayers and worship.
