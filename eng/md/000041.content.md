## Complaints (id: 500251)

The Bible teaches that complaining is often wrong. For example, God judged the Israelites for complaining about their difficulties in the wilderness ([Numbers 14:27–37](https://ref.ly/Num14:27-Num14:37)). The Job complained a lot and received God's rebuke. But God still confirmed that Job was righteous and rejected those who tried to silence him ([Job 42:7–8](https://ref.ly/Job42:7-Job42:8)).

Job's main complaint was that God did not give him a fair chance to prove his innocence. Job's friends criticized him for trying to defend himself, but God supported Job's innocence. In a kind yet firm way, God revealed himself and corrected Job for his excessive self\-defense that implied criticism of God's fairness. God redirected Job's attention from his problems to God himself ([Job 38–41](https://ref.ly/Job38:1-Job41:34)).

Scripture requires us to rejoice and give thanks in all situations ([Ephesians 5:20](https://ref.ly/Eph5:20); [Philippians 4:4](https://ref.ly/Phil4:4); [1 Thessalonians 5:16–18](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:16-1Thess5:18)). It also urges us to endure suffering and persist in prayer ([James 5:10–18](https://ref.ly/Jas5:10-Jas5:18)). If we feel the need to complain in prayer, we should follow the example of the psalms, which guide us back to God (see, for example, [Psalm 13](https://ref.ly/Ps13:1-Ps13:6)). Job's positive example is not in his response to troubles or comforters, but in his response to God ([James 5:11](https://ref.ly/Jas5:11); [Job 40:3–5](https://ref.ly/Job40:3-Job40:5); [42:1–6](https://ref.ly/Job42:1-Job42:6)). In difficult and confusing times, we can still recognize God's sovereignty and goodness.
