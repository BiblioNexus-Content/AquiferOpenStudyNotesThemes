## Temple Design as a Picture of God's Truth (id: 500319)

The temple plan in [Ezekiel 40–43](https://ref.ly/Ezek40:1-Ezek43:27) does not seem possible to build, nor was it meant to be. The plan lacks enough detail for construction, as shown by the different diagrams scholars have created. Unlike the tabernacle, the plan does not specify materials ([Exodus 25:10–40:33](https://ref.ly/Exod25:10-Exod40:33)). There is also no evidence that anyone tried to build the second temple using this plan. Therefore, Ezekiel’s temple plan is not a blueprint for future construction.

Ezekiel's temple vision shows God's message through a building design. It intends to shame Ezekiel's generation for their past and encourage future faithfulness ([Ezekiel 43:10–12](https://ref.ly/Ezek43:10-Ezek43:12)). The vision describes a new world where obvious boundaries between the holy and unholy exist, and standards are higher. This allows God to return to his temple and live among his people again (see [10:3–4](https://ref.ly/Ezek10:3-Ezek10:4), [18](https://ref.ly/Ezek10:18); [11:22–23](https://ref.ly/Ezek11:22-Ezek11:23)). 

Access to the holy area is much more limited. Faithful individuals from the past gain renewed access, while God rejects unfaithful people. There is a stronger focus on sacrifices for atonement and purification for the people.

This new temple represents Jesus Christ, who reveals God's glory. His body was a temple that others would destroy and he would rebuild in three days ([John 2:19](https://ref.ly/John2:19)). In Jesus, God's holiness shone brightly in the darkness, and the darkness could not overcome it ([John 1:5](https://ref.ly/John1:5)). His body was the perfect, one\-time sacrifice that purified the people ([Hebrews 10:12](https://ref.ly/Heb10:12)). 

Those united to Christ now have the privilege of accessing the Most Holy Place in heaven in the new Jerusalem. Its doors are always open to those who "have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb" (see [Revelation 21](https://ref.ly/Rev21:1-Rev21:27); [22:14](https://ref.ly/Rev22:14)).

Since God unites us Christians with Christ and we are part of his body, the new temple, we cannot live as we did before. The Holy Spirit lives in and among us, and our bodies now belong to him as parts of his new temple ([1 Corinthians 6:15–20](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:15-1Cor6:20)). A holy life is proof that we are God's children ([1 Peter 1:13–16](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:13-1Pet1:16)).
