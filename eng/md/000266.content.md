## The Son of God (id: 500352)

Jesus' healings, exorcisms (casting out demons), raising the dead, and teachings resulted in wonder, awe, amazement, and fear (for example, [Mark 1:22](https://ref.ly/Mark1:22), [27](https://ref.ly/Mark1:27); [4:41](https://ref.ly/Mark4:41); [5:15](https://ref.ly/Mark5:15), [20](https://ref.ly/Mark5:20), [33](https://ref.ly/Mark5:33); [7:37](https://ref.ly/Mark7:37); [9:15](https://ref.ly/Mark9:15); [10:24](https://ref.ly/Mark10:24), [26](https://ref.ly/Mark10:26), [32](https://ref.ly/Mark10:32); [12:17](https://ref.ly/Mark12:17); [15:5](https://ref.ly/Mark15:5)). This amazement emphasizes the miraculous nature of Jesus' ministry. The Gospel writers wanted readers to ask, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey Him!" ([Matthew 8:27](https://ref.ly/Matt8:27); [Mark 4:41](https://ref.ly/Mark4:41); [Luke 8:25](https://ref.ly/Luke8:25)). Mark answers this at the start of his Gospel: Jesus is the "Christ, the Son of God" ([Mark 1:1](https://ref.ly/Mark1:1)).

In the Old Testament, the title "Son of God" refers to the people of Israel ([Exodus 4:22](https://ref.ly/Exod4:22); [Deuteronomy 32:5–6](https://ref.ly/Deut32:5-Deut32:6), [18–19](https://ref.ly/Deut32:18-Deut32:19); [Psalm 82:6](https://ref.ly/Ps82:6); [Jeremiah 3:19](https://ref.ly/Jer3:19); [31:9](https://ref.ly/Jer31:9), [20](https://ref.ly/Jer31:20); [Hosea 11:1](https://ref.ly/Hos11:1); [Malachi 2:10](https://ref.ly/Mal2:10)). It can refer to angels ([Genesis 6:2](https://ref.ly/Gen6:2); [Job 1:6](https://ref.ly/Job1:6); [2:1](https://ref.ly/Job2:1); [38:7](https://ref.ly/Job38:7); [Psalm 29:1](https://ref.ly/Ps29:1)). It also has a special meaning for Israel's king, as they regarded the anointed king as God's "son" ([2 Samuel 7:14](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:14); [1 Chronicles 22:10](https://ref.ly/1Chr22:10); [28:6](https://ref.ly/1Chr28:6); [Psalms 2:7](https://ref.ly/Ps2:7); [89:26–27](https://ref.ly/Ps89:26-Ps89:27)). 

The title also appears in Jewish writings between the Old and New Testaments (including the Apocrypha and the Dead Sea Scrolls). It possibly refers to the coming Messiah (God's chosen one). Jews in the first century likely considered the coming Messiah as a "Son of God."

God confirmed Jesus as "the Son of God" at his baptism ([Mark 1:11](https://ref.ly/Mark1:11); [Matt 3:17](https://ref.ly/Matt3:17); [Luke 3:22](https://ref.ly/Luke3:22)). Demons also recognized him during his ministry ([Matthew 8:29](https://ref.ly/Matt8:29); [Mark 1:24](https://ref.ly/Mark1:24); [1:34](https://ref.ly/Mark1:34); [3:11](https://ref.ly/Mark3:11); [5:7](https://ref.ly/Mark5:7); [Luke 4:34](https://ref.ly/Luke4:34); [8:28](https://ref.ly/Luke8:28)). Later, the disciples acknowledged Jesus as the Christ ([Matthew 16:16](https://ref.ly/Matt16:16); [Mark 8:29](https://ref.ly/Mark8:29); [Luke 9:20](https://ref.ly/Luke9:20)). Jesus then began teaching them about his coming death ([Matthew 16:21](https://ref.ly/Matt16:16); [Mark 8:31](https://ref.ly/Mark8:31); [Luke 9:22](https://ref.ly/Luke9:20)). 

At the transfiguration, Jesus' appearance changed to reveal his glory as God's Son, and God confirmed what the disciples had said about Jesus ([Matthew 17:5](https://ref.ly/Matt17:5); [Mark 9:7](https://ref.ly/Mark9:7); [Luke 9:35](https://ref.ly/Luke9:35)). As Jesus neared his death, he affirmed his identity as God's Son through his teachings and during his trial ([Mark 12:1–12](https://ref.ly/Mark12:1-Mark12:12); [13:32](https://ref.ly/Mark13:32); [Mark 14:61–62](https://ref.ly/Mark14:61-Mark14:62)).

At Jesus' death on the cross, something powerful happened. A Roman soldier (called a centurion) who watched Jesus die was the first person in the story to acknowledge Jesus as "the Son of God" ([Mark 15:39](https://ref.ly/Mark15:39)). Earlier in the Gospels, people had seen Jesus was God's Son when he drove out evil spirits, and God himself had announced Jesus as his Son. But it was Jesus' willing death on the cross, and the way he died, that showed most clearly that he was truly God's Son ([Mark 15:33–39](https://ref.ly/Mark15:33-Mark15:39)).
