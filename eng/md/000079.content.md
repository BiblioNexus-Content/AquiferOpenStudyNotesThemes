## God’s Covenant with Abraham (id: 500159)

God started a relationship with Abraham before making a formal covenant (agreement) with him ([Genesis 12:1–9](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:9); [15](https://ref.ly/Gen15:1-Gen15:21)). God started the relationship with Abraham by speaking to him in a vision. God promised that the elderly Abraham would have a son. He said that he would have as many descendants as there are stars in the sky. Abraham trusted God ([15:6](https://ref.ly/Gen15:6)). God considered Abraham's faith to be an act of righteousness (see [Habakkuk 2:4](https://ref.ly/Hab2:4); [Romans 1:17](https://ref.ly/Rom1:17); [4:3](https://ref.ly/Rom4:3), [17](https://ref.ly/Rom4:17); [Galatians 3:6](https://ref.ly/Gal3:6), [11](https://ref.ly/Gal3:11); [Hebrews 10:37–38](https://ref.ly/Heb10:37-Heb10:38)).

In the ancient Near East, kings sometimes gave land or other gifts to loyal subjects. The covenant of [Genesis 15](https://ref.ly/Gen15:1-Gen15:21) includes a royal gift ([15:18–21](https://ref.ly/Gen15:18-Gen15:21)). God, the king, gave land to Abraham, his subject, to possess and inherit it. By the end of that day, Abraham knew that his future and the future of his descendants was secure. His covenant God would take care of him. Later, the land would belong to his descendants.

God later confirmed his covenant with Abraham ([Genesis 17:1–22](https://ref.ly/Gen17:1-Gen17:22)). He gave circumcision as its sign and requirement ([17:9,](https://ref.ly/Gen17:9) [10](https://ref.ly/Gen17:10)). God again visited Abraham and gave him a special privilege ([17:1–2](https://ref.ly/Gen17:1-Gen17:2)). 

The covenant was not between equals, but both sides had duties. God willingly committed to Abraham and his descendants, while expecting Abraham's faithfulness ([17:1](https://ref.ly/Gen17:1), [9–14](https://ref.ly/Gen17:9-Gen17:14)). The new name God gave him showed the blessing Abraham received as God's partner ([17:5–6](https://ref.ly/Gen17:5-Gen17:6)).

God's covenant with Abraham also included his descendants ([Genesis 13:15–16](https://ref.ly/Gen13:15-Gen13:16); [15:3–5](https://ref.ly/Gen15:3-Gen15:5); [17:6–10](https://ref.ly/Gen17:6-Gen17:10)). It promised blessings soon to come when his descendants would own the land ([15:12–16](https://ref.ly/Gen15:12-Gen15:16)). 

Much later, Abraham's faith blessed everyone through his descendant, Jesus Christ. Through Jesus, all families on earth can share in God's blessing to Abraham ([12:3](https://ref.ly/Gen12:3); see [Romans 4:11–25](https://ref.ly/Rom4:11-Rom4:25); [Galatians 3:8–9](https://ref.ly/Gal3:8-Gal3:9), [16](https://ref.ly/Gal3:16)).
