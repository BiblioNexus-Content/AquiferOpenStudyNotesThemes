## Loving Others (id: 500404)

Jesus said that loving your neighbor is the second most important commandment in the Old Testament ([Mark 12:31](https://ref.ly/Mark12:31)). The command to love sums up the entire Old Testament law ([Matthew 22:40](https://ref.ly/Matt22:40); compare [7:12](https://ref.ly/Matt7:12); [9:9–13](https://ref.ly/Matt9:9-Matt9:13); [12:1–13](https://ref.ly/Matt12:1-Matt12:13); see [Romans 13:8–10](https://ref.ly/Rom13:8-Rom13:10)). Jesus criticized the Pharisees for not showing love ([Matthew 9:13](https://ref.ly/Matt9:13); [12:7](https://ref.ly/Matt12:7); [23:4](https://ref.ly/Matt23:4), [13–14](https://ref.ly/Matt23:13-Matt23:14), [23](https://ref.ly/Matt23:23)). Love identifies a true follower of Jesus ([John 13:34–35](https://ref.ly/John13:34-John13:35)). It indicates a real experience of God ([1 John 2:9–11](https://ref.ly/1John2:9-1John2:11); [3:11–18](https://ref.ly/1John3:11-1John3:18); [4:7–21](https://ref.ly/1John4:7-1John4:21)).

For the apostle Paul, love is more important than any spiritual gift and is the most important virtue. Love “is the bond of perfect unity” ([Colossians 3:14](https://ref.ly/Col3:14)). Without love, Christian ministry has no value ([1 Corinthians 13:1–3](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:1-1Cor13:3)). Paul summarized Christian ethics as “faith expressing itself through love” ([Galatians 5:6](https://ref.ly/Gal5:6)). 

Love naturally comes from Christian faith. It is the primary fruit of the Holy Spirit ([Galatians 5:22](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22)). It is the most important motivation for Christian ministry. As Christians spiritually grow, they will desire to love others as Christ did.
