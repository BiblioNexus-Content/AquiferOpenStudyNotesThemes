## The Good News Message (id: 500386)

The apostles shared the good news about Jesus (or "gospel") in a specific order, with these parts: 

1. The Old Testament promises came true through Jesus Christ's life, death, and resurrection.
2. God has lifted up Jesus by raising him from the dead to be the leader of the new people of God as the Messiah chosen by God.
3. The apostles witnessed God's work in Jesus Christ. They saw his public ministry and resurrection ([Acts 2:32](https://ref.ly/Acts2:32); [3:15](https://ref.ly/Acts3:15); [4:33](https://ref.ly/Acts4:33); [5:30–32](https://ref.ly/Acts5:30-Acts5:32); [13:30–31](https://ref.ly/Acts13:30-Acts13:31)). They served as his chosen messengers ([10:39–43](https://ref.ly/Acts10:39-Acts10:43)).
4. The right response to this good news is to repent (turn away from sin) and trust in Jesus ([Acts 2:38](https://ref.ly/Acts2:38); [3:19](https://ref.ly/Acts3:19); [13:39](https://ref.ly/Acts13:39), [48](https://ref.ly/Acts13:48); [17:30](https://ref.ly/Acts17:30); [20:21](https://ref.ly/Acts20:21); [26:20](https://ref.ly/Acts26:20)).
5. God promises to give the Holy Spirit to those who accept God's forgiveness and salvation from sin through Jesus Christ.

The apostles often shared this basic message with both Jews and non\-Jews (called gentiles) across the Mediterranean region (see [Acts 1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8); [9:15](https://ref.ly/Acts9:15)). You can find it in the speeches of Peter and Philip in [2:14–41](https://ref.ly/Acts2:14-Acts2:41); [3:12–26](https://ref.ly/Acts3:12-Acts3:26); [4:8–12](https://ref.ly/Acts4:8-Acts4:12); [5:29–32](https://ref.ly/Acts5:29-Acts5:32); [8:4–13](https://ref.ly/Acts8:4-Acts8:13), [26–40](https://ref.ly/Acts8:26-Acts8:40); and [10:34–43](https://ref.ly/Acts10:34-Acts10:43). Paul’s preaching also includes these themes (for example, [Acts 13:16–49](https://ref.ly/Acts13:16-Acts13:49); [1 Corinthians 15:1–11](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:1-1Cor15:11)).

This powerful message of God's saving grace changes people's wills and minds to obey him. Receiving this message is the first step towards salvation. God calls everyone to repent from sin and trust in the saving power of Jesus ([Acts 4:12](https://ref.ly/Acts4:12); [13:38](https://ref.ly/Acts13:38); [16:30–31](https://ref.ly/Acts16:30-Acts16:31)). Through Jesus, God continues to make everyone right with him who continues to trust in him ([13:39](https://ref.ly/Acts13:39)).
