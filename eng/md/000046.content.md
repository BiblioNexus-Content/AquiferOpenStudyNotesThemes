## Counsel from Others (id: 500254)

The book of Proverbs teaches that having many advisors are good because they provide safety ([Proverbs 11:14](https://ref.ly/Prov11:14); [24:6](https://ref.ly/Prov24:6)). They increase our chances of success ([Proverbs 15:22](https://ref.ly/Prov15:22)). The book of Job shows that advisors can also mislead, even if what they believe about God seems correct ([Job 12:17](https://ref.ly/Job12:17); [26:3](https://ref.ly/Job26:3)).

At first, Job’s friends joined him in his suffering, sitting silently in grief for seven days ([Job 2:11–13](https://ref.ly/Job2:11-Job2:13)). Yet, their comfort ended once they spoke. Job’s friends often talked about the biblical idea of sowing and reaping, which is an important part of the covenant ([Leviticus 26](https://ref.ly/Lev26:1-Lev26:46); [Deuteronomy 28](https://ref.ly/Deut28:1-Deut28:68); [Proverbs 1:31](https://ref.ly/Prov1:31); [22:8](https://ref.ly/Prov22:8); [Hosea 8:7](https://ref.ly/Hos8:7); see also [Galatians 6:7–8](https://ref.ly/Gal6:7-Gal6:8)). We cannot dismiss their words. This is because much of what they said is correct teaching about God’s nature and how he acts towards humans. 

Yet, Job’s friends misapplied this idea (see [Job 4:8](https://ref.ly/Job4:8)). They did not examine Job’s life to find where he had done wrong and then warn of divine judgment. Instead, they ignored Job’s faithful life and focused on his suffering. Then they assumed he was suffering because of sin. God eventually called these advisors liars. This reminds us that we must correctly apply true things about God to please God and help others ([Proverbs 15:2–4](https://ref.ly/Prov15:2-Prov15:4), [23](https://ref.ly/Prov15:23); [25:11](https://ref.ly/Prov25:11); [Isaiah 50:4](https://ref.ly/Isa50:4); [Ephesians 4:29](https://ref.ly/Eph4:29)).

It is good to consider advice from different sources. But we should compare it with what we believe is right before God (see, for example, [Acts 20:22](https://ref.ly/Acts20:22); [21:4](https://ref.ly/Acts21:4), [11](https://ref.ly/Acts21:11), [13](https://ref.ly/Acts21:13)). God might use human advisors to help us understand his will. But he also guides us through his Spirit ([John 16:13–15](https://ref.ly/John16:13-John16:15)). 

Jesus Christ is our “Wonderful Counselor” ([Isaiah 9:6](https://ref.ly/Isa9:6); see [Isaiah 28:29](https://ref.ly/Isa28:29)). He has “all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” ([Colossians 2:3](https://ref.ly/Col2:3)). When we support others in times of grief, we should be careful and thoughtful in applying teachings from Scripture. Often, our silent presence is the most helpful help we can give.
