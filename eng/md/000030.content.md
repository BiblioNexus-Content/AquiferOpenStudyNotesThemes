## Christian Giving (id: 500409)

Generous Christian giving shows true grace. We see this in "our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich" ([2 Corinthians 8:9](https://ref.ly/2Cor8:9); [Philippians 2:5–8](https://ref.ly/Phil2:5-Phil2:8)). We have received his undeserved favor in salvation, and we give generously in response to “His indescribable gift!” ([2 Corinthians 9:15](https://ref.ly/2Cor9:15)).

Jesus taught that generosity shows who follows him ([Matthew 25:34–36](https://ref.ly/Matt25:34-Matt25:36)). He emphasized the importance of a person's intentions and attitude, not only the amount given ([Mark 12:41–44](https://ref.ly/Mark12:41-Mark12:44)).

In 2 Corinthians, the apostle Paul emphasizes the theme of giving. He encourages the church at Corinth to give generously to help those in need, especially the poor Jewish Christians in Jerusalem ([2 Corinthians 8:6–7](https://ref.ly/2Cor8:6-2Cor8:7); [9:1–5](https://ref.ly/2Cor9:1-2Cor9:5)). This generosity would show that gentile Christians and Jewish Christians in Jerusalem are part of the same "body."

Here is a summary of Paul's teachings about Christian giving:

1. Our giving should come from a willing mind and heart ([2 Corinthians 8:12](https://ref.ly/2Cor8:12); [9:7](https://ref.ly/2Cor9:7)). Paul emphasizes motives because the reason behind our giving is most important.
2. True giving brings joy, unlike reluctant gifts ([2 Corinthians 9:5](https://ref.ly/2Cor9:5)). When we give to others, it brings joy, just as a farmer is happy when planting (sowing seed) because they know crops will grow ([9:6–10](https://ref.ly/2Cor9:6-2Cor9:10)). Sharing with those in need also brings joy ([9:1–2](https://ref.ly/2Cor9:1-2Cor9:2)).
3. Christian giving is generous and may involve sacrifice, as shown by the Macedonians ([2 Corinthians 8:1–5](https://ref.ly/2Cor8:1-2Cor8:5)).
4. Handling financial gifts requires honesty, integrity, and care. Paul was careful to protect his colleagues who collected gifts from the churches from suspicion ([2 Corinthians 8:20–21](https://ref.ly/2Cor8:20-2Cor8:21)). People managing church donations should have a proven reputation and responsibility.

Christian living should show a generous concern for those in need. Paul instructs Christians to please God, not themselves ([2 Corinthians 5:15](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:15)). Christians should live under Jesus' leadership and his love should motivate them ([5:14](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:14)). We can show his love clearly through our giving.
