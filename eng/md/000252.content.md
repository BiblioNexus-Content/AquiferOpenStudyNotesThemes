## The Promise of a Second Exodus (id: 500298)

God brought the people of Israel back to their homeland from Babylon, just as he had brought them out of Egypt many years before ([Isaiah 48:20–21](https://ref.ly/Isa48:20-Isa48:21)). (This first rescue from Egypt is called the exodus.) This time, when leaving Babylon, the people needed to be pure and take their time, not rushing to leave ([52:11](https://ref.ly/Isa52:11)[,12](https://ref.ly/Isa52:12)).

The experience in exile and the journey compare to a desert from which the Lord rescues (see [Isaiah 35:1](https://ref.ly/Isa35:1)):

* He creates a road through the desert and turns it into a place with water, plants, and animals ([Isaiah 43:19–20](https://ref.ly/Isa43:19-Isa43:20)).
* He removes obstacles ([42:16](https://ref.ly/Isa42:16); [49:11](https://ref.ly/Isa49:11)).
* He guides his people ([42:16](https://ref.ly/Isa42:16); [58:11](https://ref.ly/Isa58:11); [63:13](https://ref.ly/Isa63:13)).
* He feeds them ([49:10](https://ref.ly/Isa49:10)).
* He protects them from the heat ([49:10](https://ref.ly/Isa49:10)).
* He gives them strength ([58:11](https://ref.ly/Isa58:11)).
* He changes their sorrow into great joy ([51:3](https://ref.ly/Isa51:3)).
* He pours out his Spirit on them ([44:3–4](https://ref.ly/Isa44:3-Isa44:4)).

Christians also experience an "exodus." They leave behind sin and death through Jesus' death and resurrection. The Holy Spirit helps Christians have a new life. They serve God joyfully while waiting for his kingdom to fully arrive.
