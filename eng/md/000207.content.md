## The Cities of Refuge (id: 500198)

The Israelites built the cities of refuge to protect innocent people from blood revenge. An avenger had the legal right to kill a murderer ([Numbers 35:19](https://ref.ly/Num35:19); see [Genesis 9:6](https://ref.ly/Gen9:6)). If someone accidentally caused a death, the person fled to a city of refuge for temporary safety while awaiting trial ([Numbers 35:22–28](https://ref.ly/Num35:22-Num35:28)). The six cities of refuge spread across Hebrew territory so any Israelite could seek refuge.

After the trial, if the elders of the city found the person guilty of murder (instead of accidental killing), they handed him over to the avenger for punishment ([Deuteronomy 19:12](https://ref.ly/Deut19:12)). If they found the person innocent, the killer stayed in the city of refuge for safety. When the high priest died, the killer could return home without fear of blood revenge. This compassionate law prevented the land from pollution by innocent blood (see [Numbers 35:33](https://ref.ly/Num35:33)).

Paying a fine to repay the death of a person was not acceptable, even if the death was accidental ([Numbers 35:31–33](https://ref.ly/Num35:31-Num35:33)). Human life was too valuable for money to purchase it. When someone killed another person, whether on purpose or by accident, it led to alienation or exile.

Atonement is not easy, whether in ancient Israelite times or today. Everyone needs atonement to restore their relationship with God (see [Romans 3:23–26](https://ref.ly/Rom3:23-Rom3:26)). Jesus, the Son of God, offers this reconciliation. He acts as the great high priest and died as the ultimate sacrifice (see [Hebrews 4:14–10:18](https://ref.ly/Heb4:14-Heb10:18)).
