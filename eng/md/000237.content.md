## The Little Horn (id: 500323)

In the vision of the prophet Daniel, the little horn represents a king. It has human\-like features, such as eyes and a mouth. This imagery is typical of apocalyptic literature. 

"Apocalyptic" is from a Greek word meaning "reveal." So, this kind of message or writing reveals the hidden plans of God. Apocalyptic writings often using mysterious language and images. The little horn draws Daniel's attention because of its boastful speech and violent actions against other kings, God's people, and the Most High God.

What or who is the little horn? The little horn in [Daniel 7:8](https://ref.ly/Dan7:8) links to evil figures in [9:27](https://ref.ly/Dan9:27) and [11:40–45](https://ref.ly/Dan11:40-Dan11:45). Antiochus IV Epiphanes shares qualities with the little horn in [7:8](https://ref.ly/Dan7:8), but they are not the same ([8:9–14](https://ref.ly/Dan8:9-Dan8:14), [23–25](https://ref.ly/Dan8:23-Dan8:25); [11:21–39](https://ref.ly/Dan11:21-Dan11:39)). 

Both ancient and modern interpreters believe the little horn represents the future antichrist (a powerful leader who will strongly oppose God and God's people). Some think certain historical figures from the Greek and Roman empires, like Antiochus IV Epiphanes, Nero, Caligula, and Domitian, have partially fulfilled this vision. According to this perspective, this future person will be a man, not a demon or Satan.

Some see the little horn as a symbol of evil opposing God and his people. Some interpreters think no single person will fulfill this vision. Instead, they believe it represents evil forces in the world. Others believe the antichrist has already appeared. The New Testament suggests the idea of the antichrist will have a final fulfillment (see [2 Thessalonians 2:3–12](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:3-2Thess2:12); [1 John 2:18](https://ref.ly/1John2:18); [4:3](https://ref.ly/1John4:3); [2 John 1:7](https://ref.ly/2John1:7); [Revelation 13:1](https://ref.ly/Rev13:1), [5](https://ref.ly/Rev13:5); [16:13–14](https://ref.ly/Rev16:13-Rev16:14); [17:11](https://ref.ly/Rev17:11); [19:20–21](https://ref.ly/Rev19:20-Rev19:21); [20:10](https://ref.ly/Rev20:10)).

This little horn reminds God's people that evil strongly opposes God and his people. The king mentioned here takes over the world's kingdoms ([Daniel 7:8](https://ref.ly/Dan7:8)). But his evil system will not win because God will destroy evil. God's people can find comfort in knowing this time of evil will not last long ([Revelation 12:12](https://ref.ly/Rev12:12)). God will destroy the works of this evil kingdom ([Daniel 7:11–12](https://ref.ly/Dan7:11-Dan7:12)). 

God's chosen ruler, who appears "like a son of man" (looking like a human being), is given authority by God (called "the Ancient of Days" in this vision; [Daniel 7:13–14](https://ref.ly/Dan7:13-Dan7:14)). He will rule with God's approval and power, and his rule will last in a kingdom that cannot be destroyed. God encourages his people to endure and remain faithful. They live in hope of a righteous kingdom where God will live among them (see [Revelation 21:3](https://ref.ly/Rev21:3)). "The zeal of the LORD of Hosts will accomplish this" ([Isaiah 9:7](https://ref.ly/Isa9:7)).
