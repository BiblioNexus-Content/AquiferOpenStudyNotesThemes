## Visions (id: 500385)

Visions are similar to other experiences of God's revelation, like dreams ([Genesis 37:5–10](https://ref.ly/Gen37:5-Gen37:10); [40:5–19](https://ref.ly/Gen40:5-Gen40:19)). Classic examples include the prophet Ezekiel’s vision of the valley of dry bones and the prophet Isaiah’s vision of God’s throne ([Ezekiel 37:1–14](https://ref.ly/Ezek37:1-Ezek37:14); [Isaiah 6](https://ref.ly/Isa6:1-Isa6:13)). Old Testament prophets often received messages from the Lord through visions. The visions in the Bible often showed powerful and memorable pictures that helped people understand God's message.In these visions, God showed special pictures or scenes that had deeper meanings about real things happening on earth. God or an angel would then explain to the person what these pictures meant.

Visions are important in the book of Acts and often occur during prayer ([Acts 9:10–12](https://ref.ly/Acts9:10-Acts9:12); [16:9–10](https://ref.ly/Acts16:9); [22:17–21](https://ref.ly/Acts22:17-Acts22:21); [23:11](https://ref.ly/Acts23:11); see [Luke 1:8–20](https://ref.ly/Luke1:8-Luke1:20)). In one instance, an angel visited Cornelius, a Roman officer ([Acts 10:1–6](https://ref.ly/Acts10:1-Acts10:6), [30–32](https://ref.ly/Acts10:30-Acts10:32)). The angel told him to send for the apostle Peter. The next day, as Peter prayed, he had a vision ([10:9–16](https://ref.ly/Acts10:9-Acts10:16); see [11:5–10](https://ref.ly/Acts11:5-Acts11:10)). It was connected to his meeting with Cornelius. 

In Acts 9, the visions of the apostle Paul and Ananias also show God's role in their lives ([9:3–6](https://ref.ly/Acts9:3-Acts9:6), [10–16](https://ref.ly/Acts9:10-Acts9:16)). These visions are not by accident but part of God's plan to save the world.

Visions provide divine guidance and show Christian workers how to fulfill the Great Commission. 

Paul experienced several visions: 

* during his conversion on the Damascus road ([Acts 9:3–6](https://ref.ly/Acts9:3-Acts9:6); [22:6–10](https://ref.ly/Acts22:6-Acts22:10); [26:12–19](https://ref.ly/Acts26:12-Acts26:19))
* before his missionary journey to Europe ([16:9](https://ref.ly/Acts16:9))
* in Corinth ([18:9–11](https://ref.ly/Acts18:9-Acts18:11))
* in the temple ([22:17–21](https://ref.ly/Acts22:17-Acts22:21))
* in Jerusalem before his trip to Rome ([23:11](https://ref.ly/Acts23:11))

Through visions, God actively guides the church's activities and expands its mission (see the study notes on Acts 10:3, 9–16; 22:17–22; 23:11; see also [Galatians 1:8–9](https://ref.ly/Gal1:8-Gal1:9) and study note there).
