## Symbolic Numbers (id: 500445)

Numbers in Scripture have often led people to strange conclusions. Understanding ancient number symbolism can help us interpret the Scriptures better. Yet, this symbolism is not precise. We must be careful when using numbers in interpretation to avoid making unrealistic predictions about the future.

In the Bible, numbers often have special meanings:

* The number *one* can refer to God's unity ([Deuteronomy 6:4](https://ref.ly/Deut6:4); [Galatians 3:20](https://ref.ly/Gal3:20); [James 2:19](https://ref.ly/Jas2:19)).
* *Two* is the minimum number of people needed to provide a valid witness in court ([Deuteronomy 17:6](https://ref.ly/Deut17:6); [Revelation 11:3](https://ref.ly/Rev11:3)).
* *Three* can imply divine presence ([Genesis 18:1–2](https://ref.ly/Gen18:1-Gen18:2); [2 Corinthians 13:14](https://ref.ly/2Cor13:14); [Revelation 1:4–5](https://ref.ly/Rev1:4-Rev1:5)).
* *Four* can represent the known world. The book of Revelation indicates this with living creatures, horsemen, winds, and angels ([Revelation 4:6–8](https://ref.ly/Rev4:6-Rev4:8); [6:1–8](https://ref.ly/Rev6:1-Rev6:8); [7:1](https://ref.ly/Rev7:1)). [Genesis 2:10–14](https://ref.ly/Gen2:10-Gen2:14) indicates this with *four* rivers.
* Adding *three* and *four* to make *seven* represents perfection or divine fulfillment. This shows harmony between God and the world.
* Multiplying *three* by *four* gives *twelve*, the number linked to God's people ([Genesis 35:22–26](https://ref.ly/Gen35:22-Gen35:26); [Exodus 24:4](https://ref.ly/Exod24:4); [28:21](https://ref.ly/Exod28:21); [Numbers 17:2](https://ref.ly/Num17:2); [Joshua 4:3–8](https://ref.ly/Josh4:3-Josh4:8); [1 Kings 18:31](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:31); [Matthew 10:1–4](https://ref.ly/Matt10:1-Matt10:4); [19:28](https://ref.ly/Matt19:28); [James 1:1](https://ref.ly/Jas1:1); [Revelation 12:1](https://ref.ly/Rev12:1); [21:12–22:2](https://ref.ly/Rev21:12-Rev22:2)).
* The number *five* and its multiples, like *ten*, represent human completeness. For example, there are *five* fingers per hand.
* *Six* has a negative meaning, suggesting imperfection. It is neither humanly complete (*five*) nor divinely complete (*seven*).
* Multiples of *ten* represent *many* (for example, *forty*). In contrast, *three sixes* or "666" suggest extreme evil ([Revelation 13:18](https://ref.ly/Rev13:18)).
* *One thousand* is the basic large number. The number 12,000 represents a large group of God’s people ([Revelation 7:5–8](https://ref.ly/Rev7:5-Rev7:8)). One hundred and forty\-four thousand represents all of God's people ([Revelation 7:4](https://ref.ly/Rev7:4); [14:1](https://ref.ly/Rev14:1)). The Greek transliteration *myriads* best represents what some translations call "10,000\." This is because it is really a huge number, rather than an exact count.

Some numbers in the Bible have symbolic meanings. Yet, it is extremely doubtful to use them to guess when Christ will return or when the world will end. Only God knows these things ([Mark 13:32](https://ref.ly/Mark13:32)). God did not intend for the symbolic numbers in Revelation to predict the future. Instead, they explain the importance of the visions. 

Translating these numbers into modern sizes, distances, or quantities can sometimes lose their theological meaning. These symbolic numbers can show how a vision relates to the world or to God's people.
