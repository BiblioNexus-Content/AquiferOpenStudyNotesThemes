## God's Rule and Power Over All Nations (id: 500329)

In ancient times, most people thought each nation had its own god or gods. For example, the king of Aram thought Israel's gods were only powerful in the hills ([1 Kings 20:23](https://ref.ly/1Kgs20:23)). When the judge Jephthah talked about the false god Chemosh giving land to the Ammonites, he was showing he still thought like people who worshiped many gods ([Judges 11:24](https://ref.ly/Judg11:24)). 

In contrast, the prophet Amos knew that God alone brought the Philistines from Crete and the Arameans from Kir ([Amos 9:7](https://ref.ly/Amos9:7)). God created the entire universe, not just Israel ([4:13](https://ref.ly/Amos4:13); [5:8](https://ref.ly/Amos5:8)). So, he had the right to demand that nations act with justice and mercy ([1:3–2:3](https://ref.ly/Amos1:3-Amos1:2)).

A common false belief (heresy) among the people of Judah and Israel was that despite their sins, God would eventually support them because of his covenant with them (see [Jeremiah 7:4](https://ref.ly/Jer7:4); [Amos 3:1–2](https://ref.ly/Amos3:1-Amos3:2); [9:10](https://ref.ly/Amos9:10)). They mistakenly believed that the "day of the Lord" meant automatic rescue for them and destruction for their enemies. Amos directly challenged this false sense of privilege ([9:7](https://ref.ly/Amos9:7); see also [5:18–20](https://ref.ly/Amos5:18-Amos5:20)). The day of the Lord would not forgive sinful Israel. Instead, God would use it to punish them.

Israel's privileged position among nations made them more responsible. While nearby nations experienced punishment for severe sins, God punished Israel for all their sins ([Amos 3:2](https://ref.ly/Amos3:2)). The New Testament expands on this idea: "Everyone who has been given much" has greater responsibility ([Luke 12:48](https://ref.ly/Luke12:48); [James 3:1](https://ref.ly/Jas3:1)).
