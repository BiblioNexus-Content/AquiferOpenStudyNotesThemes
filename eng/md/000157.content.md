## Promised Land (id: 500165)

God gave the first man and woman the task of governing the earth and ruling over creation. This was to meet their needs and honor the creator ([Genesis 1:28–30](https://ref.ly/Gen1:28-Gen1:30)). But when humanity sinned, they became separated from God, each other, and the land on which they lived ([3:17–19](https://ref.ly/Gen3:17-Gen3:19); see [4:3–16](https://ref.ly/Gen4:3-Gen4:16); compare [5:29](https://ref.ly/Gen5:29)).

God called Abram to follow him by faith and receive Canaan as a special homeland. This land was a promised place for his descendants as God's people ([Genesis 12:1–3](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:3), [7](https://ref.ly/Gen12:7); [13:14–18](https://ref.ly/Gen13:14-Gen13:18); [15:7–21](https://ref.ly/Gen15:7-Gen15:21); [17:7–8](https://ref.ly/Gen17:7-Gen17:8)). Later, God freed Israel from slavery in Egypt. At Mount Sinai, he made a covenant (special agreement) with them to be his people. Then they received the land promised to their ancestors.

Keeping the land depended on obedience. If Israel violated the covenant, they would encounter its curses. The worst curse was exile from the promised land ([Leviticus 26:32–33](https://ref.ly/Lev26:32-Lev26:33)). This eventually happened because of Israel's continued rebellion against the Lord. He sent them into exile to Assyria and Babylon. They lost their land, and their enemies destroyed the temple of God ([2 Kings 17:5–23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:5-2Kgs17:23); [25:1–21](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:1-2Kgs25:21)). 

Yet, God also promises that when the people repent, “then I will remember My covenant … and I will remember the land” ([Leviticus 26:42](https://ref.ly/Lev26:42)). During the exile to Babylon, the prophet Jeremiah and other prophets saw God's future restoration of his people and their return to the land ([Jeremiah 32:36–44](https://ref.ly/Jer32:36-Jer32:44)). This happened during the rule of King Cyrus the Great of Persia (see the books of Ezra and Nehemiah).

The promises about the land still wait for their final fulfillment. God plans to prepare an eternal homeland for his people. In this homeland, God will rule directly and justly as king. Everyone and everything will follow God's will. Death and sin will no longer exist. The needs of God's people will be fully met ([Hebrews 11:13–16](https://ref.ly/Heb11:13-Heb11:16); [Revelation 21](https://ref.ly/Rev21:1-Rev21:27)).
