## Jesus’ Ascension (id: 500378)

When Jesus went up to heaven, he gave his apostles their final instructions and authority for their work ([Acts 1:6–11](https://ref.ly/Acts1:6-Acts1:11); [Luke 24:45–53](https://ref.ly/Luke24:45-Luke24:53)). This event (the ascension) marked the start of the Holy Spirit's powerful work through the church ([Luke 24:49](https://ref.ly/Luke24:49)).

Jesus' ascension to heaven shows that he now has ultimate power and authority as God and man ([Ephesians 1:19–23](https://ref.ly/Eph1:19-Eph1:23); [Philippians 2:9–11](https://ref.ly/Phil2:9-Phil2:11)). Other passages also mention Jesus going to the Father ([John 6:62](https://ref.ly/John6:62); [13:1–3](https://ref.ly/John13:1-John13:3); [13:31–14:3](https://ref.ly/John13:31-John14:3), [14:28](https://ref.ly/John14:28); [16:5–10](https://ref.ly/John16:5-John16:10), [16](https://ref.ly/John16:16), [28](https://ref.ly/John16:28); [20:17](https://ref.ly/John20:17); [Ephesians 4:8–10](https://ref.ly/Eph4:8-Eph4:10)). This happened during Jesus' last physical appearance. After this, he would stay in heaven until "the restoration of all things" ([Acts 3:21](https://ref.ly/Acts3:21)).

The ascension reminds Christians of Jesus' promise to return ([Acts 1:11](https://ref.ly/Acts1:11); see [Matthew 24:30](https://ref.ly/Matt24:30); [Mark 13:26](https://ref.ly/Mark13:26); [John 14:3](https://ref.ly/John14:3)). Those present at the ascension returned to Jerusalem with joy and excitement, praising and worshiping Jesus ([Luke 24:52](https://ref.ly/Luke24:52)). They trusted that Jesus would return again, both physically and personally ([1 Thessalonians 4:16](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:16); [2 Thessalonians 1:7–10](https://ref.ly/2Thess1:7-2Thess1:10); [2 Peter 3:10](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:10)).

The ascension of Jesus anticipates the Christian's future entrance into God's presence. Jesus has gone ahead to "prepare a place" ([John 14:1–3](https://ref.ly/John14:1-John14:3); [2 Corinthians 5:4](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:4); [Philippians 3:21](https://ref.ly/Phil3:21); [Hebrews 6:19–20](https://ref.ly/Heb6:19-Heb6:20)).
