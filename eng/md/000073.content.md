## God Works through Prayer (id: 500244)

God has authority and control over all creation. But he wants people to share their concerns with him through prayer. The Bible shows examples of God responding to people's prayers. Prayer is important for living a godly life and effective Christian service. It helps people submit their will to God.

The short book of Nehemiah tells the story of a man devoted to prayer. When he saw Jerusalem's poor condition, Nehemiah prayed intensely for four months (see [Nehemiah 1:1](https://ref.ly/Neh1:1); [2:1](https://ref.ly/Neh2:1)). His prayers praised God for his power and love. Nehemiah confessed the nation's sins and asked God to help ([1:4–11](https://ref.ly/Neh1:4-Neh1:11); see also [Ezra 9:6–15](https://ref.ly/Ezra9:6-Ezra9:15); [Daniel 9:4–19](https://ref.ly/Dan9:4-Dan9:19)). Nehemiah's based his prayer for Jerusalem on God's "covenant of loving devotion with those who love Him and keep His commandments" ([1:5](https://ref.ly/Neh1:5)). 

The Israelites had not followed the instructions God gave to Moses ([1:7](https://ref.ly/Neh1:7)). As God had warned, this disobedience resulted in their exile. Yet, Nehemiah firmly believed that God would restore the nation if the people repented ([1:8–9](https://ref.ly/Neh1:8-Neh1:9); see [Deuteronomy 4:25–31](https://ref.ly/Deut4:25-Deut4:31); [30:1–5](https://ref.ly/Deut30:1-Deut30:5)).

God gave Nehemiah a chance to speak to the Persian king about returning to Jerusalem. Nehemiah prayed for guidance ([Nehemiah 2:4](https://ref.ly/Neh2:4)). He understood that only God could change the king's will. Later, Nehemiah responded to threats against the builders of Jerusalem's wall by posting guards and encouraging the people. Yet, he also prayed for protection and strength ([Nehemiah 4:4–5](https://ref.ly/Neh4:4-Neh4:5), [9](https://ref.ly/Neh4:9); [6:9](https://ref.ly/Neh6:9), [14](https://ref.ly/Neh6:14)). He needed God's help and blessing both then and in the future as he dealt with those who behaved wrongly.

Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem after a short visit to Persia. He learned that some Jews were not giving their tithe ([Nehemiah 13:10–12](https://ref.ly/Neh13:10-Neh13:12)). Some were not observing the Sabbath ([13:15–16](https://ref.ly/Neh13:15-Neh13:16)). Some had married non\-Jews ([13:23–24](https://ref.ly/Neh13:23-Neh13:24)). When he confronted them about their actions, Nehemiah prayed for God to show him compassion and remember his efforts ([13:14](https://ref.ly/Neh13:14), [22](https://ref.ly/Neh13:22), [31](https://ref.ly/Neh13:31)). Nehemiah understood that only God's power could change people.

Jesus knew well the Father's will, yet his ministry had its basis in prayer (see, for example, [Luke 5:16](https://ref.ly/Luke5:16); [6:12–16](https://ref.ly/Luke6:12-Luke6:16); [9:18](https://ref.ly/Luke9:18)). Following his example, early Christians prayed often, believing firmly in its power (see, for example, [9:36–41](https://ref.ly/Acts9:36-Acts9:41); [12:3–11](https://ref.ly/Acts12:3-Acts12:11)). God often responds powerfully to prayers. God wants Christians to pray with confidence, expecting him to answer (see [James 5:16–18](https://ref.ly/Jas5:16-Jas5:18)).
