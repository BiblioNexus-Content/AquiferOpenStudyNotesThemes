## The Messianic Banquet (id: 500362)

Through his teaching and miracles, Jesus showed that the messianic banquet was ready. The messianic banquet is a special feast that God promised to prepare when the Messiah came. He invited all people to come and receive God's salvation and become part of God's kingdom.

Jesus compared his ministry to a wedding feast, with himself as the groom ([Luke 5:33–35](https://ref.ly/Luke5:33-Luke5:35)). The kingdom of God was like a grand banquet. God invited everyone, but some chose not to attend ([Luke 14:15–24](https://ref.ly/Luke14:15-Luke14:24); see also [Matthew 8:11–12](https://ref.ly/Matt8:11-Matt8:12)). Jesus often shared meals with a variety of people. This included disliked tax collectors and committed Pharisees ([5:29–32](https://ref.ly/Luke5:29-Luke5:32); [7:36–50](https://ref.ly/Luke7:36-Luke7:50); [11:37–41](https://ref.ly/Luke11:37-Luke11:41); [14:1–6](https://ref.ly/Luke14:1-Luke14:6)). 

He also used the imagery of feasting and banquets in his teachings and parables ([Luke 5:33–35](https://ref.ly/Luke5:33-Luke5:35); [12:35–38](https://ref.ly/Luke12:35-Luke12:38); [14:7–14](https://ref.ly/Luke14:7-Luke14:14), [15–24](https://ref.ly/Luke14:15-Luke14:24); [17:7–10](https://ref.ly/Luke17:7-Luke17:10); [22:28–30](https://ref.ly/Luke22:28-Luke22:30)). Additionally, he fed large crowds with just a few loaves and fishes ([9:10–17](https://ref.ly/Luke9:10-Luke9:17)).

The Old Testament background for this feast imagery is [Isaiah 25:6](https://ref.ly/Isa25:6). It describes God's final salvation as a great feast for everyone: “the LORD of Hosts will prepare a lavish banquet for all the peoples, a feast of aged wine, of choice meat, of finely aged wine” (see also [Isaiah 65:13–14](https://ref.ly/Isa65:13-Isa65:14)).

Jesus' public ministry began the invitation to the banquet and its beginning. Through his death and resurrection, he brought salvation. Now, everyone can come to God's banquet table and receive the kingdom's spiritual blessings. Yet, this banquet will fully happen in the future kingdom. Then, Jesus' disciples will "eat and drink at My table in My kingdom" and "sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel" ([Luke 22:30](https://ref.ly/Luke22:30); see also [Revelation 19:7–9](https://ref.ly/Rev19:7-Rev19:9)).
