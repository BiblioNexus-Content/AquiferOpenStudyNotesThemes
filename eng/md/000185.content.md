## Solomon’s Wisdom (id: 500221)

When God gave King Solomon the chance to ask for anything, Solomon chose wisdom. He wanted to govern God's people well and know right from wrong ([1 Kings 3:9](https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:9)). Because of this unselfish choice, God granted him the wisdom he wanted and the rewards of using it properly ([3:12, 1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:12)[3–14](https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:13-1Kgs3:14); [2 Chronicles 1:14–17](https://ref.ly/2Chr1:14-2Chr1:17)).

Solomon's actions quickly showed his wisdom. He solved a dispute over a child so wisely that it amazed the people ([1 Kings 3:16–28](https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:16-1Kgs3:28)). Later, the queen of Sheba visited to challenge him with difficult questions. She found his wisdom greater than she had heard ([10:1–9](https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:1-1Kgs10:9)). 

Many things showed Solomon's wisdom, including:

* how he organized and managed his government and officials ([4:1–28](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:1-1Kgs4:28));
* how he handled relationships with other nations and kings ([5:1–9](https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:1-1Kgs5:9));
* the structures he built, especially the temple and his palace ([5:10–7:51](https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:10-1Kgs7:51)); and
* his business dealings and trade with other nations ([9:26–28](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:26-1Kgs9:28); [10:14–29](https://ref.ly/1Kgs10:14-1Kgs10:29)).

Solomon gained vast knowledge ([4:29–33](https://ref.ly/1Kgs4:29-1Kgs4:33)). He wrote proverbs (much of the book of Proverbs) as well as songs ([Psalms 72](https://ref.ly/Ps72:1-Ps72:20); [127](https://ref.ly/Ps127:1-Ps127:5)). He also wrote love poetry (see the Song of Songs) and philosophical works (see Ecclesiastes). He used his wisdom to build the temple ([2 Chronicles 2:12](https://ref.ly/2Chr2:12)). This was like Bezalel who had been given wisdom to build the tabernacle ([Exodus 31:1–3](https://ref.ly/Exod31:1-Exod31:3)).

Jesus emphasized Solomon's great wisdom and told his listeners that, "One greater than Solomon is here" ([Matthew 12:42](https://ref.ly/Matt12:42)). Jesus is the true wisdom of God, where one can find ultimate wisdom ([1 Corinthians 1:24](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:24)). A wise life is centered in Jesus and in Scripture ([1 Corinthians 1:18–25](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:18-1Cor1:25); [Colossians 3:16](https://ref.ly/Col3:16); [2 Peter 3:18](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:18); [2 Timothy 3:14–17](https://ref.ly/2Tim3:14-2Tim3:17)).
