## Marriage and Sexuality (id: 500278)

Scripture considers marriage holy from the very beginning. Sexual expression is an important part of it ([Genesis 2:23–25](https://ref.ly/Gen2:23-Gen2:25)). The first human sin caused a disruption in all relationships. This first happened between God and humans, then between husband and wife, and even between humans and creation ([Genesis 3](https://ref.ly/Gen3:1-Gen3:24)). The division between Adam and Eve showed in their sexuality. They could no longer be naked in the garden without feeling shame.

In Proverbs, the wise teacher often warns young men to avoid sexual temptations outside of marriage ([Proverbs 2:16–22](https://ref.ly/Prov2:16-Prov2:22); [5:1–23](https://ref.ly/Prov5:1-Prov5:23); [6:20–7:27](https://ref.ly/Prov6:20-Prov7:27)). While a young man might find other women attractive, acting on these temptations can have severe consequences. His family and career goals might become destroyed. Proverbs advises young men to build a strong relationship with their wives. The Scripture encourages men to have a healthy marital relationship instead of being with other women ([5:15–20](https://ref.ly/Prov5:15-Prov5:20)).

Although this section of Proverbs was first written to teach young men, everyone can think about these issues of marriage and sexuality. The book of Proverbs encourages everyone to recognize the holiness and beauty of marital love as God, the wise Creator, planned it.

The New Testament emphasizes the holiness of sexuality and its proper expression within marriage. Jesus refers to the creation story in Genesis to emphasize the intended permanence of marriage. After quoting [Genesis 2:24](https://ref.ly/Gen2:24), he says, “So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate” ([Matthew 19:3–6](https://ref.ly/Matt19:3-Matt19:6)). The apostle Paul talks about the importance of maintaining sexual intimacy in marriage to prevent temptation by Satan ([1 Corinthians 7:3–5](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:3-1Cor7:5)). God wants those who marry to stay faithful to each other and avoid harmful sexual activities that could damage their holy relationship (see [Hebrews 13:4](https://ref.ly/Heb13:4)).
