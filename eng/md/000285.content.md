## Trusting God in Isaiah (id: 500292)

The prophet Isaiah knew that humans can be unreliable ([Isaiah 2:22](https://ref.ly/Isa2:22)). When in trouble, the people of Judah often asked other nations like Egypt or Assyria for help. Yet, Isaiah explained that Judah's success and safety depended on trusting God (see [Isaiah 8:9–17](https://ref.ly/Isa8:9-Isa8:17)). The Assyrian army made fun of King Hezekiah for trusting God, but this trust led to a great victory for God's people ([Isaiah 36:1–37:37](https://ref.ly/Isa36:1-Isa37:37)).

Those who trust in the Lord feel deep respect for him and do not fear ([29:23](https://ref.ly/Isa29:23); [35:4](https://ref.ly/Isa35:4)). This is because they know the Lord is with them ([51:12](https://ref.ly/Isa51:12)). They praise him because they trust him ([12:1–2](https://ref.ly/Isa12:1-Isa12:2); [25:9](https://ref.ly/Isa25:9)). They show their trust by obeying him ([26:8](https://ref.ly/Isa26:8)). 

The faithful people of God may experience the effects of his judgment on his enemies as they wait for the Lord’s salvation. Yet, they gain new strength each day ([40:31](https://ref.ly/Isa40:31)). They consider themselves citizens of God’s city, Zion (see [26:1–3](https://ref.ly/Isa26:1-Isa26:3)). Those who trust in the Lord have true and lasting inner peace ([26:3](https://ref.ly/Isa26:3), [12](https://ref.ly/Isa26:12); [32:17–18](https://ref.ly/Isa32:17-Isa32:18)).
