## The Gift of Prophecy (id: 500390)

As the apostle Peter stated on the day of Pentecost, prophecy was a result of God's Holy Spirit poured out ([Acts 2:17–21](https://ref.ly/Acts2:17-Acts2:21); see [Joel 2:28–32](https://ref.ly/Joel2:28-Joel2:32)). The book of Acts mentions a few Christian prophets ([Acts 11:27–28](https://ref.ly/Acts11:27-Acts11:28); [13:1](https://ref.ly/Acts13:1); [15:32](https://ref.ly/Acts15:32); [21:9–11](https://ref.ly/Acts21:9-Acts21:11); see also *The Martyrdom of Polycarp* 12:3; 16:2\). One of these prophets was Agabus, who acted like an Old Testament prophet by performing symbolic acts ([Acts 21:10–11](https://ref.ly/Acts21:10-Acts21:11); see [1 Kings 11:29–32](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:29-1Kgs11:32); [Isaiah 20:2–6](https://ref.ly/Isa20:2-Isa20:6); [Jeremiah 13:1–11](https://ref.ly/Jer13:1-Jer13:11); [Ezekiel 4:1–5:17](https://ref.ly/Ezek4:1-Ezek5:17)). He also prophesied future events ([Acts 11:28](https://ref.ly/Acts11:28); [21:10–11](https://ref.ly/Acts21:10-Acts21:11)).

Philip the Evangelist had four daughters "who prophesied” ([Acts 21:9](https://ref.ly/Acts21:9)). The apostle Paul also recognized that some Christian women had this prophetic gift ([1 Corinthians 11:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:5)). In the Old Testament, most prophets were men, but some women were also prophets, like Miriam, Deborah, and Huldah ([Exodus 15:20](https://ref.ly/Exod15:20); [Judges 4:4](https://ref.ly/Judg4:4); [2 Kings 22:14–20](https://ref.ly/2Kgs22:14-2Kgs22:20); [2 Chronicles 34:22–28](https://ref.ly/2Chr34:22-2Chr34:28)). In the New Testament, both men and women, young and old, receive the gift of prophecy, as Peter mentioned in his sermon on the day of Pentecost ([Acts 2:17–18](https://ref.ly/Acts2:17-Acts2:18)).

Prophecy sometimes involves predicting the future ([Acts 20:22–23](https://ref.ly/Acts20:22-Acts20:23); [21:10–1](https://ref.ly/Acts21:10-Acts21:11); see [Romans 9:24–33](https://ref.ly/Rom9:24-Rom9:33); [1 Thessalonians 4:13–17](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:13-1Thess4:17); [2 Thessalonians 2:3–4](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:3-2Thess2:4)). At its core, prophecy is about sharing God's message by preaching, urging, and explaining God's will ([Acts 15:32](https://ref.ly/Acts15:32); [19:6](https://ref.ly/Acts19:6); [Romans 12:6](https://ref.ly/Rom12:6); [1 Corinthians 14:3–4](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:3-1Cor14:4), [29–33](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:29-1Cor14:33); [Revelation 19:10](https://ref.ly/Rev19:10)). The gift of prophecy is plainly mentioned in the letters of 1 Corinthians and Ephesians as one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit and Jesus to his church ([1 Corinthians 12:4–11](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:4-1Cor12:11); [Ephesians 4:11–13](https://ref.ly/Eph4:11)). It is intended to benefit Christians ([1 Corinthians 14:22](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:22)).

Prophecy needs testing ([1 Thessalonians 5:19–21](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:19-1Thess5:21)). The church receives strong warnings about false prophets ([1 John 4:1](https://ref.ly/1John4:1); see also [Revelation 2:20–23](https://ref.ly/Rev2:20-Rev2:23)). Christians must use this gift faithfully and as the Scriptures and God's Spirit instruct. Boldly sharing God's truth helps the church understand God's will and motivates people to obey it.
