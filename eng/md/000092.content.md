## God’s Name on His Temple (id: 500233)

In his prayer of dedication, King Solomon said the temple was the house where God would put his name ([2 Chronicles 6:20](https://ref.ly/2Chr6:20); compare [6:5–6](https://ref.ly/2Chr6:5-2Chr6:6)). God said that King David would build "a house for My Name" in Jerusalem ([2 Samuel 7:4–17](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:4-2Sam7:17)). When God puts his name on a place, it means it belongs to God.

For the people of Israel, the temple represented the land God promised to them and was marked by God's name. It was the ultimate symbol of God's relationship with Israel. Solomon prayed that God would remember this relationship and listen to their prayers at the temple. 

In many English Bible translations, Yahweh is represented as "LORD" written in all capital letters(see [Exodus 3:13–15](https://ref.ly/Exod3:13-Exod3:15)). Solomon's prayer uses God's personal name. This made the temple the main symbol of Israel's faith. The temple was the chosen place where the people kept and remembered God's covenant (the special agreement that God made with the Israelites). This is where the people of Israel called on God's name and acknowledged him in confession and praise.

The fulfillment of God's promise to put his name on his temple is now found in the "living temple," which is the community of God's people. The apostle Peter urges believers to come to "the living stone, rejected by men but chosen and precious in God’s sight, you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ" ([1 Peter 2:4–5](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:4-1Pet2:5)). 

Just as God's name was connected to the temple, the center of God's presence and worship in the Old Testament, God's name now rests on the church, God's people, who are the new temple in the New Testament.
