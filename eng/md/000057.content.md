## Endurance (id: 500434)

When Jesus was about to suffer and die, he told his followers they would also experience great difficulties (see [Matthew 24:9](https://ref.ly/Matt24:9)). He emphasized the importance of endurance: “The one who perseveres to the end will be saved” ([Matthew 24:13](https://ref.ly/Matt24:13)). Many New Testament writings were for Christians suffering for their faith in Christ (see, for example, [2 Thessalonians 1:4](https://ref.ly/2Thess1:4); [1 Peter 4:12–19](https://ref.ly/1Pet4:12-1Pet4:19)). These Christians needed encouragement to persevere through difficulty while remaining committed to Christ and sharing their faith with others (see [2 Timothy 4:5](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:5); [1 Peter 4:1](https://ref.ly/1Pet4:1)). Through endurance, Christians grow in character and develop spiritual maturity ([Romans 5:3–4](https://ref.ly/Rom5:3-Rom5:4); [James 1:2–4](https://ref.ly/Jas1:2-Jas1:4)).

The book of Hebrews spoke to Christians who had encountered many challenges. People harassed them, took their property, and imprisoned them ([Hebrews 10:32–34](https://ref.ly/Heb10:32-Heb10:34)). 

At the time of writing, they had similar issues. They needed to "hold firmly" to their beliefs without wavering ([4:14](https://ref.ly/Heb4:14); [10:23](https://ref.ly/Heb10:23)). They must endure while waiting for God's promises to come true ([6:12](https://ref.ly/Heb6:12); [10:36](https://ref.ly/Heb10:36)). Like runners in a race, they needed to "run with endurance the race set out for" them ([12:1](https://ref.ly/Heb12:1)). As true children of a loving father, they were to accept the Lord's discipline to grow in holiness ([12:5–13](https://ref.ly/Heb12:5-Heb12:13)).

The great examples of endurance in Scripture, such as Job and the prophets, can inspire all Christians ([Hebrews 11:35–40](https://ref.ly/Heb11:35-Heb11:40); [James 5:10–11](https://ref.ly/Jas5:10-Jas5:11)). Christ, our main model of endurance, "endured the cross," because of "the joy set before Him" ([12:1–3](https://ref.ly/Heb12:1-Heb12:3)). This same hope for the future inspires us to endure.
