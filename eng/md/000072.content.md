## God Protects His Servant (id: 500305)

When God called the prophet Jeremiah as his messenger, he promised to protect him. This protection was spiritual, as the Lord gave Jeremiah inner strength "like a fortified city" ([Jeremiah 1:18](https://ref.ly/Jer1:18)). God's protection was also physical: “They will fight against you but will never overcome you” ([1:19](https://ref.ly/Jer1:19)).

During King Josiah’s rule (from 640 to 609 BC), Jeremiah was safe and did not experience serious threats to his life. Things changed when Jehoiakim became king (from 609 to 598 BC). The king and his officials quickly became hostile, putting Jeremiah's life at risk. But the Lord promised to protect him (see [Jeremiah 11:18–23](https://ref.ly/Jer11:18-Jer11:23)). 

This promise seemed broken when Pashhur arrested, whipped, and put Jeremiah in stocks ([Jeremiah 20:1–2](https://ref.ly/Jer20:1-Jer20:2)). Jeremiah questioned the Lord for misleading him. But soon he regained his trust ([20:7–13](https://ref.ly/Jer20:7-Jer20:13)). Early in Jehoiakim’s rule, he arrested Jeremiah and put him on trial (chapter [26](https://ref.ly/Jer26:1-Jer26:24)). The Lord strengthened Jeremiah internally, helping him stay calm. 

Some elders who served under King Josiah protected him. They reminded others of King Hezekiah’s response to danger a century earlier. Ahikam saved Jeremiah’s life ([Jeremiah 26:24](https://ref.ly/Jer26:24)). Jeremiah went into hiding when Jehoiakim’s officers tried to kill him. The Lord kept him hidden until after Jehoiakim’s death ([36:19–20](https://ref.ly/Jer36:19-Jer36:20), [26](https://ref.ly/Jer36:26)).

The new king, Zedekiah, treated Jeremiah more kindly. Yet, Jeremiah encountered danger several times during the attack against Jerusalem. At one point, the king’s officials threw him into a muddy well (cistern). God protected Jeremiah by inspiring a foreigner named Ebed\-melech, to save him. Zedekiah then put Jeremiah in protective custody ([Jeremiah 38](https://ref.ly/Jer38:1-Jer38:28)).

Jeremiah survived when the Babylonians captured Jerusalem. Although he was almost taken captive to Babylon. God influenced the Babylonian general to free Jeremiah. He offered him a choice. He could go to Babylon as a free man or stay with Gedaliah, the new governor of Judah ([Jeremiah 39:11–14](https://ref.ly/Jer39:11-Jer39:14); [40:1–6](https://ref.ly/Jer40:1-Jer40:6)). God also protected Jeremiah from Johanan and his group, who forced Jeremiah and Baruch to go to Egypt ([43:1–7](https://ref.ly/Jer43:1-Jer43:7)).

God kept his promises to Jeremiah. He continues to keep his promises to all his people. He does not always promise to physically protect those who serve him (see [2 Corinthians 6:4–5](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:4-2Cor6:5); [2 Timothy 2:10–13](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:10-2Tim2:13); [3:11–13](https://ref.ly/2Tim3:11-2Tim3:13); [1 Peter 2:21–23](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:21-1Pet2:23); [3:14–17](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:14-1Pet3:17); [Revelation 14:12](https://ref.ly/Rev14:12)). But he promises eternal salvation to those who trust in him ([James 1:12](https://ref.ly/Jas1:12); [1 Peter 1:6–9](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:6-1Pet1:9); [4:12–19](https://ref.ly/1Pet4:12-1Pet4:19)).
