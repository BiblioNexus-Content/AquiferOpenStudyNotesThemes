## Our Advocate (id: 500372)

In the Gospel of John, the Greek word *paraklētos* refers to the Holy Spirit. This word literally means "called alongside" and describes him as "Advocate" ([John 14:16](https://ref.ly/John14:16), [26](https://ref.ly/John14:26); [15:26](https://ref.ly/John15:26); [16:7](https://ref.ly/John16:7)). This term appears in other Greek texts, where it refers to a legal advocate. This is someone who speaks in a person's defense in court and gives legal advice. 

"Counselor" is a common translation, but its modern meaning related to psychology can be misleading. The older legal sense of a lawyer giving advice is more accurate. 

"Comforter" is another common translation, but it can also be misleading. The older English meaning of someone who strengthens, or an "encourager," aligns better with the New Testament idea of *paraklētos.*

Jesus described the Spirit as *another* "Advocate" ([John 14:16](https://ref.ly/John14:16)). Jesus, the first advocate, sent the Holy Spirit as the second Advocate (see [1 John 2:1](https://ref.ly/1John2:1)). Every task of the Spirit described in [John 14–16](https://ref.ly/John14:1-John16:33) is a task Jesus performed elsewhere in the gospel stories. Jesus promised that the Holy Spirit would come to encourage, instruct, and strengthen his followers. The Spirit would maintain Jesus' presence among his disciples. Five promises about the Spirit show different works the Spirit does ([John 14:16–17](https://ref.ly/John14:16-John14:17), [26](https://ref.ly/John14:26); [15:26](https://ref.ly/John15:26); [16:7–8](https://ref.ly/John16:7-John16:8), [13–14](https://ref.ly/John16:13-John16:14)).

The Spirit became available to Jesus' disciples after his death (see [John 7:39](https://ref.ly/John7:39); [20:22](https://ref.ly/John20:22)). The Spirit now continues Jesus' work and presence in the lives of Christians ([14:16–26](https://ref.ly/John14:16-John14:26)).
