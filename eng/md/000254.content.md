## The Promise of New Life (id: 500317)

The resurrection is a key belief in Christianity. Without it, the Christian faith has no value ([1 Corinthians 15:14](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:14)). God promises that his people will share in this resurrection with Christ ([Colossians 3:1](https://ref.ly/Col3:1)). It is important to plainly understand the new life God promises us.

[Ezekiel 37](https://ref.ly/Ezek37:1-Ezek37:28) might seem to suggest that everyone will resurrect with new bodies after death. Yet, the prophet Ezekiel is not asking, "Can human bones come back to life?" Ezekiel and his audience already knew about the possibility of resurrection from the miracles of Elijah and Elisha ([1 Kings 17:17–24](https://ref.ly/1Kgs17:17-1Kgs17:24); [2 Kings 4:31–37](https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:31-2Kgs4:37); [13:20–21](https://ref.ly/2Kgs13:20-2Kgs13:21)). Instead, Ezekiel is asking, "Can *these* bones live?" He is questioning if God can restore the nation of Judah since they are a stripped, broken apart, and dried\-up nation.

At that time, the Babylonians had devastated Judah, destroyed the temple, and exiled many people to Babylon. The nation had lost its power, been broken politically, and was spiritually exhausted. Those still in Judah were a small group, only the poorest of the poor (see [2 Kings 25:8–12](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:8-2Kgs25:12)). Many believed there was no future for God's people. They said, “Our bones are dried up, and our hope has perished; we are cut off” ([Ezekiel 37:11](https://ref.ly/Ezek37:11)). The question was not whether God *could* revive them, but whether he *would* perform such a miracle for the dry bones representing Israel.

The prophet answered this question with a strong *Yes!* God would bring his people back to life by pouring out his Spirit, responding to the prophet's word. Their death because of their sins was real. But God would not leave them in the grave (see [Psalm 16:10](https://ref.ly/Ps16:10)). Instead, he promised that in the future he would give his people life through his Spirit. He would transform them into a new creation, a new Spirit\-filled Israel. This new people of God would stand as a mighty army to serve the Lord.

God can bring back to life those who are physically or spiritually dead. He chooses to give new life to sinners who do not deserve it (see [John 3:5–7](https://ref.ly/John3:5-John3:7); [Ephesians 2:1–7](https://ref.ly/Eph2:1-Eph2:7)). Those who suffer from sin also receive the new life God offers through his Spirit, both now and forever (see [Romans 8:5–13](https://ref.ly/Rom8:5-Rom8:13); [Colossians 3:1–11](https://ref.ly/Col3:1-Col3:11)). He makes people, whom the world sees as beyond saving, acceptable to him through Christ ([1 Corinthians 6:9–11](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:9-1Cor6:11)). He also prepares them for meaningful work in his service ([Ephesians 4:12–13](https://ref.ly/Eph4:12-Eph4:13); [6:11–18](https://ref.ly/Eph6:11-Eph6:18)).
