## God’s Faithfulness to His People (id: 500224)

God made a special agreement (called a covenant) with the people of Israel. It included blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience (see [Deuteronomy 28:1–68](https://ref.ly/Deut28:1-Deut28:68)). Many years later, after King Solomon dedicated the temple, the Lord appeared to him. He reminded Solomon that if the people were unfaithful to this covenant, judgment would come ([1 Kings 9:6–9](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:6-1Kgs9:9)). But, if they were faithful, God would live among them and never abandon them ([6:12–13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs6:12-1Kgs6:13)).

God chose the nation of Israel as his covenant people ([Exodus 19:5–6](https://ref.ly/Exod19:5-Exod19:6); [1 Kings 8:53](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:53)). Despite this special role, the people of Israel often rebelled against God (see, for example, [Exodus 32:1–6](https://ref.ly/Exod32:1-Exod32:6); [Numbers 14:1–12](https://ref.ly/Num14:1-Num14:12); [Judges 2:10–15](https://ref.ly/Judg2:10-Judg2:15)). Even during the peak of God's blessings under Solomon's rule, they "were still sacrificing on the high places" ([3:2](https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:2)). They showed their ongoing commitment to pagan worship (see also [1 Kings 11:4–13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:4-1Kgs11:13)). 

Both the northern and southern kingdoms later committed this sin ([12:31–32](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:31-1Kgs12:32); [13:2](https://ref.ly/1Kgs13:2), [32–33](https://ref.ly/1Kgs13:32-1Kgs13:33); [14:22–24](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:22-1Kgs14:24); [15:14](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:14); [22:43](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:43)). Every ruler of the northern kingdom led the people into false religious practices. This caused Israel's exile by Assyria in 722 BC. The southern kingdom had occasional religious reforms. But these were temporary, and Judah was eventually exiled by the Babylonians in 586 BC. 

Yet, God kept a faithful group among his people (see, for example, [1 Kings 19:18](https://ref.ly/1Kgs19:18); [Isaiah 10:20–34](https://ref.ly/Isa10:20-Isa10:34)). He had plans for their future well\-being (see [Isaiah 4:2–6](https://ref.ly/Isa4:2-Isa4:6); [Isaiah 40:1–11](https://ref.ly/Isa40:1-Isa40:11); [Jeremiah 30:1–24](https://ref.ly/Isa30:1-Isa30:24)). Despite their unfaithfulness, God remained loving and faithful and wanted to restore them ([Hosea 2:1–23](https://ref.ly/Hos2:1-Hos2:23)).

God still has a group of people who belong to him ([1 Corinthians 1:2](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:2); [1 Peter 1:1](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:1)). Those who follow Jesus are his "chosen people" ([1 Peter 2:9–10](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:9-1Pet2:10)). They are "the temple of the living God" ([2 Corinthians 6:14–7:1](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:14-2Cor7:1)). God promises that he will never abandon them. He will always keep his promises to them ([John 14:16](https://ref.ly/John14:16); [2 Timothy 2:13](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:13)).
