## The Holy Spirit’s Presence (id: 500379)

The book of Acts emphasizes the presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Before the Spirit came, Jesus spoke about the Spirit's influence on his followers ([1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8); see [John 14:15–17](https://ref.ly/John14:15-John14:17), [26](https://ref.ly/John14:26); [15:26](https://ref.ly/John15:26); [16:7–15](https://ref.ly/John16:7-John16:15)). The Spirit clearly guided the early church in selecting Spirit\-filled leaders to care for the needs of the Hellenistic widows ([Acts 6:1–7](https://ref.ly/Acts6:1-Acts6:7)). These were Greek\-speaking Jewish widows who needed help in the daily distribution of food. The Holy Spirit chose the apostles Barnabas and Saul for missionary work ([13:1–5](https://ref.ly/Acts13:1-Acts13:5)). When the first church council met to discuss the membership of non\-Jewish people (gentiles), they followed the Spirit's direction ([15:28](https://ref.ly/Acts15:28)). 

The Holy Spirit filled Christian workers Stephen and Philip to preach with the Spirit's power ([Acts 6:1–8:40](https://ref.ly/Acts6:1-Acts8:40)). The Spirit energized the apostle Paul's ministry from the start ([9:17](https://ref.ly/Acts9:17)). In the book of Acts, the church increased and expanded under the Holy Spirit's guidance and power (for example, [2:4](https://ref.ly/Acts2:4), [41–47](https://ref.ly/Acts2:41-Acts2:47); [4:31](https://ref.ly/Acts4:31); [5:32](https://ref.ly/Acts5:32); [8:15](https://ref.ly/Acts8:15), [17](https://ref.ly/Acts8:17), [29](https://ref.ly/Acts8:29); [9:31](https://ref.ly/Acts9:31)). Because of the Spirit's important role in Acts, people often call it “the Acts of the Holy Spirit.”

The Holy Spirit acts in many ways:

* The Holy Spirit gives and restores life ([Genesis 2:7](https://ref.ly/Gen2:7); [Psalm 104:24–30](https://ref.ly/Ps104:24-Ps104:30); [Ezekiel 37:1–14](https://ref.ly/Ezek37:1-Ezek37:14); [Joel 2:28–32](https://ref.ly/Joel2:28-Joel2:32); [Romans 8:9–11](https://ref.ly/Rom8:9-Rom8:11)).
* The Holy Spirit calls and chooses workers for Christ's service ([Acts 13:2](https://ref.ly/Acts13:2); [20:28](https://ref.ly/Acts20:28)).
* The Holy Spirit directs God's servants where and when he wants them to act ([Acts 8:29](https://ref.ly/Acts8:29); [9:15](https://ref.ly/Acts9:15); [10:19–20](https://ref.ly/Acts10:19-Acts10:20); [11:12](https://ref.ly/Acts11:12); [16:6](https://ref.ly/Acts16:6); [1 Corinthians 2:13](https://ref.ly/1Cor2:13); [1 Peter 1:12](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:12)).
* The Holy Spirit inspired the writing of Scripture ([2 Timothy 3:16–17](https://ref.ly/2Tim3:16-2Tim3:17); [2 Peter 1:20–21](https://ref.ly/2Pet1:20-2Pet1:21)).
* The Holy Spirit teaches the church Christ's message ([John 14:26](https://ref.ly/John14:26); [1 Corinthians 12:3](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:3)).
* The Holy Spirit shows the power of the good news about Jesus (the gospel) through miraculous signs and wonders ([Acts 14:3](https://ref.ly/Acts14:3); [Hebrews 2:4](https://ref.ly/Heb2:4)).
* The Holy Spirit teaches God's people the truths of Scripture ([Acts 1:16](https://ref.ly/Acts1:16); [Hebrews 9:8](https://ref.ly/Heb9:8); [10:15–17](https://ref.ly/Heb10:15-Heb10:17); [1 Peter 1:11–12](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:11-1Pet1:12)).
* The Holy Spirit testifies about Jesus and brings him glory ([John 15:26](https://ref.ly/John15:26); [16:13–14](https://ref.ly/John16:13-John16:14)).
* The Holy Spirit makes people aware of their sins and their need for the good news ([John 16:8](https://ref.ly/John16:8)).
* The Holy Spirit warns them against becoming stubborn ([Hebrews 3:7–11](https://ref.ly/Heb3:7-Heb3:11), [15](https://ref.ly/Heb3:15)).
* The Holy Spirit gives gifts to God's people ([1 Corinthians 12:4–11](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:4-1Cor12:11)).
* The Holy Spirit empowers them to share the good news, serve the Lord, and work for God's kingdom.
