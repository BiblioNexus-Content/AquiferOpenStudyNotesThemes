## Human Confusion and God’s Purpose (id: 500331)

God is not missing or only occasionally involved in human lives. He actively determines events in the world to fulfill his purpose ([Habakkuk 2:3](https://ref.ly/Hab2:3), [14](https://ref.ly/Hab2:14); see also [Psalm 47:9](https://ref.ly/Ps47:9); [Acts 17:24–26](https://ref.ly/Acts17:24-Acts17:26); [Colossians 1:15–20](https://ref.ly/Col1:15-Col1:20)). The Lord is holy and merciful, acting in history to save his people ([Habakkuk 3:2–15](https://ref.ly/Hab3:2-Hab3:15); see also [Ephesians 1:3–10](https://ref.ly/Eph1:3-Eph1:10); [2 Peter 3:15](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:15)). This is so that everyone can eventually experience his glory ([Habakkuk 2:14](https://ref.ly/Hab2:14)).

Often, how God achieves his goals can confuse his people. This confusion is obvious in the prophetic book of Habakkuk. Habakkuk had an open relationship with God. The prophet felt free to share his honest concerns with the Lord. God did not criticize him for it. 

From Habakkuk's perspective, God seemed inactive in the presence of violence and social injustice in Judah ([Habakkuk 1:2–4](https://ref.ly/Hab1:2-Hab1:4)). God then revealed that he would act by bringing the Babylonians to punish Judah. They were a nation even more wicked than Judah ([1:5–11](https://ref.ly/Hab1:5-Hab1:11)). This confused Habakkuk even more. Yet, God's promise of justice and a vision of God's glory led the prophet to a firm faith and praise ([3:16–19](https://ref.ly/Hab3:16-Hab3:19)).

Habakkuk's spiritual journey is similar to many Christians. During times of doubt and discouragement, Christians can talk to the Lord and share their questions and concerns. He may not give all the answers, and the answers he gives might not be what we want. Yet, like Habakkuk, we might gain a new understanding of who God is, helping us renew our trust in the one who is in control.
