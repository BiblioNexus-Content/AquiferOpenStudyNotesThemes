## All Is “Vapor” (id: 500286)

A key word in the book of Ecclesiastes is the Hebrew term *hebel.* This word means "vapor." Often it is translated as "meaningless." This word captures the main view about life in this world of the Teacher. The Teacher, also called Qoheleth, is the main speaker in the book of Ecclesiastes.

The Hebrew word *hebel* means physical "breath" or "vapor." *Hebel* appears seventy\-eight times in the Old Testament, but only three times does it obviously refer to the physical sense ([Psalm 62:9](https://ref.ly/Ps62:9); [Proverbs 21:6](https://ref.ly/Prov21:6); [Isaiah 57:13](https://ref.ly/Isa57:13)). In the other seventy\-five instances, it metaphorically describes what is hard to understand, futile, meaningless, false, temporary, or without substance. 

The term often describes the lack of substance, lack of reality, and lack of worth of false gods ([Deuteronomy 32:21](https://ref.ly/Deut32:21); [2 Kings 17:15](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:15)). In this sense, *hebel* is the opposite of "glory." God's glory is his presence that has substance, is weighty, and lasting. Sometimes, *hebel* represents how life is short and momentary, like vapor ([Job 7:16](https://ref.ly/Job7:16); [Psalm 144:4](https://ref.ly/Ps144:4)). In other cases, it refers to the how meaningless and frustrating life can be ([Psalms 78:33](https://ref.ly/Ps78:33); [94:11](https://ref.ly/Ps94:11); [Isaiah 49:4](https://ref.ly/Isa49:4)).

There is a long tradition of interpreting *hebel* in Ecclesiastes as meaning "vanity." This does not mean thinking too highly of oneself. But it refers to experiencing life as empty and without purpose. The ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament used the word *mataiotēs*, meaning "emptiness" or "futility." 

The Latin Vulgate then translated *hebel* with the Latin word *vanitas*, which means "without purpose," "hollow," or "without worth." From the Vulgate comes the tradition of translating the word as "vanity" in English. Most translators today understand *hebel* to mean that life on earth seems to have no clear purpose or meaning, and all that we do feels futile.

Some translators interpret *hebel* in Ecclesiastes as referring mainly to life's temporary nature. A vapor has no permanence or weight. This translation suggests a different view of Ecclesiastes. Life is not meaningless and futile, but rather not permanent and quickly ending. Many phrases in Ecclesiastes hint at the quick or short nature of human life and its efforts. 

In the New Testament, a similar idea appears in [James 4:13–15](https://ref.ly/Jas4:13-Jas4:15). Understanding *hebel* as "not permanent" in Ecclesiastes helps explain the book plainly. But it is a less common view among scholars. 

When reading Ecclesiastes, remember the root of the word is "breath" or "vapor," which supports the metaphors. The shortness and challenges of life can feel depressing. This should encourage us to work hard and wisely, and enjoy life while possible. We have all experienced life's unfair events, like a foolish person succeeding or unpunished injustice. These things make more sense when we remember God is in control. God will judge everything we do, including all secrets, whether good or bad ([Ecclesiastes 12:14](https://ref.ly/Eccl12:14)).
