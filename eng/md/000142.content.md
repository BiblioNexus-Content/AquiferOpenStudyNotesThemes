## Misunderstanding in the Gospel of John (id: 500370)

In John's Gospel, people often misunderstood Jesus (see [John 3:4](https://ref.ly/John3:4); [4:11](https://ref.ly/John4:11), [33](https://ref.ly/John4:33); [7:35](https://ref.ly/John7:35); [11:12–13](https://ref.ly/John11:12-John11:13)). They disagreed about who Jesus was. When they realized what he truly meant, some wanted to arrest him, while others wanted to follow him ([7:40–44](https://ref.ly/John7:40-John7:44)). Only later, after the disciples received the Holy Spirit, did they fully understand his importance (see [16:12–13](https://ref.ly/John16:12-John16:13)).

The world remains in spiritual darkness and struggles to understand life or God ([John 1:5](https://ref.ly/John1:5), [10](https://ref.ly/John1:10)). People cannot understand God's messages on their own unless God helps them understand. God's spiritual light enters the darkness, revealing the world's flaws. Many people retreat further into spiritual darkness because they prefer it over the light ([3:19–20](https://ref.ly/John3:19-John3:20)). Only God's Spirit can transform and help people see plainly as God's children do ([3:21](https://ref.ly/John3:21); [8:12](https://ref.ly/John8:12); [12:35–36](https://ref.ly/John12:35-John12:36), [46](https://ref.ly/John12:46)).
