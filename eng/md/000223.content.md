## The Glory of God (id: 500172)

*Glory* in the Old Testament means something different than in English. In English, it often describes something temporary, like a sunset or last year's winning team. 

The Hebrew word for *glory* means what is "heavy" or "solid." It implies "importance" or "worth." This is the opposite of "temporary" or "empty." When God's glory appears, it is not just a bright light or a shining cloud. It is a visible sign of his absolute reality.

God's glory shows his presence, power, and majesty (see [Ezekiel 1:28](https://ref.ly/Ezek1:28); [10:4](https://ref.ly/Ezek10:4)). God's glory may appear in nature, like during a thunderstorm or in the plagues on the Egyptians ([Job 37:2–5](https://ref.ly/Job37:2-Job37:5); [Psalm 29:3](https://ref.ly/Ps29:3), [7](https://ref.ly/Ps29:7); [Numbers 14:21–22](https://ref.ly/Num14:21-Num14:22)). God's glory can also be a special event, like the revelation on Mount Sinai ([Deuteronomy 5:24](https://ref.ly/Deut5:24)). When God established the tabernacle and King Solomon's temple, God's glory filled them ([Exodus 40:34–35](https://ref.ly/Exod40:34-Exod40:35); [1 Kings 8:10–11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:10-1Kgs8:11)). This showed his approval and presence there. Similarly, the glory of the Lord sent the fire that started the first sacrifices in the holy place ([Leviticus 9:22–24](https://ref.ly/Lev9:22-Lev9:24)).

When God shows his glory to his creation, it is often called a *theophany* (see, for example, [Exodus 24:16–18](https://ref.ly/Exod24:16-Exod24:18)). God provides limited views of his glory because he says, "no one can see Me and live" ([Exodus 33:18–23](https://ref.ly/Exod33:18-Exod33:23); see also [Isaiah 6:5](https://ref.ly/Isa6:5)). To “give glory” to God means to speak or act in a way that acknowledges who God is ([Joshua 7:19](https://ref.ly/Josh7:19); [Isaiah 24:15](https://ref.ly/Isa24:15); [Jeremiah 13:16](https://ref.ly/Jer13:16)).

Jesus Christ reflects God's glory and image ([2 Corinthians 4:4](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:4)). Through his death and resurrection, God glorified him ([John 17:1–5](https://ref.ly/John17:1-John17:5)). When Jesus returns, he will show God's glory in his restored kingdom ([Revelation 21:11](https://ref.ly/Rev21:11), [23](https://ref.ly/Rev21:23)). The apostle Paul says that Christ's presence in Christians' lives guarantees us that we will share in that glory ([Romans 5:2](https://ref.ly/Rom5:2); [Colossians 1:27](https://ref.ly/Col1:27)).
