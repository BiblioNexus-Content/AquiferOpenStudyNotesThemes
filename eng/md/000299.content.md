## Zion (id: 500266)

*Zion* is the Hebrew name for the mountain in Jerusalem where the temple was located ([2 Samuel 5:7](https://ref.ly/2Sam5:7); see also [2 Chronicles 3:1](https://ref.ly/2Chr3:1)). Over time, people began using the name Zion to refer to all of Jerusalem. Zion can refer to the real city of Jerusalem, which the Babylonians destroyed in 586 BC (see [102:13](https://ref.ly/Ps102:13); [126:1](https://ref.ly/Ps126:1); [137:1](https://ref.ly/Ps137:1)). Rome destroyed it again in AD 70\.

Zion also means more than just a physical place. It represents God's kingdom that exists everywhere ([Psalm 74:2](https://ref.ly/Ps74:2); [76:2](https://ref.ly/Ps76:2); [84:7](https://ref.ly/Ps84:7); [135:21](https://ref.ly/Ps135:21); see [Isaiah 26](https://ref.ly/Isa26:1-Isa26:21)). In this spiritual city where God lives, people trust God and do what is right and good. God does not accept evil behavior, worship of false gods, or unfair treatment of others in his city. 
  
The prophets and poets of Israel wrote that God's city is larger than the physical city of Jerusalem. People from Judah, Israel, and all nations can become citizens of this spiritual city (see [Psalm 87:5–6](https://ref.ly/Ps87:5-Ps87:6); [Hebrews 12:22–24](https://ref.ly/Heb12:22-Heb12:24)). Zion is on a high mountain at the center of God’s kingdom on earth ([Psalm 48:2](https://ref.ly/Ps48:2); [99:2](https://ref.ly/Ps99:2); [132:13](https://ref.ly/Ps132:13)). God’s throne is there ([9:11](https://ref.ly/Ps9:11)). Because of this, God's people direct their prayers and praise toward Zion ([53:6](https://ref.ly/Ps53:6); [65:1](https://ref.ly/Ps65:1); [147:12](https://ref.ly/Ps147:12); [149:2](https://ref.ly/Ps149:2)). They also look to Zion for God's salvation ([14:7](https://ref.ly/Ps14:7); [20:2](https://ref.ly/Ps20:2); [50:2](https://ref.ly/Ps50:2); [53:6](https://ref.ly/Ps53:6)). God chose David's family line to rule over Zion and establish his kingdom everywhere ([2:6](https://ref.ly/Ps2:6); [110:2](https://ref.ly/Ps110:2)).  
  
Zion represents God's protection and blessings ([Psalms 46:4–11](https://ref.ly/Ps46:4-Ps46:11); [48:1–14](https://ref.ly/Ps48:1-Ps48:14); [51:18](https://ref.ly/Ps51:18); [128:5](https://ref.ly/Ps128:5); [134:3](https://ref.ly/Ps134:3)). Anyone who trusts in the Lord is secure "like Mount Zion" ([Psalm 125:1](https://ref.ly/Ps125:1)). Those who reject the Lord also reject Zion's security and have no future ([129:5–8](https://ref.ly/Ps129:5-Ps129:8)). 

The New Testament describes Mount Zion as a heavenly Jerusalem, the spiritual home for people from all nations spiritually "born again" through faith in Jesus Christ ([Hebrews 12:22–24](https://ref.ly/Heb12:22-Heb12:24); see also [Galatians 4:24–26](https://ref.ly/Gal4:24-Gal4:26); [Revelation 3:12](https://ref.ly/Rev3:12); [21:2–4](https://ref.ly/Rev21:2-Rev21:4)). Abraham looked forward in faith to "the city with foundations" ([Hebrews 11:10](https://ref.ly/Heb11:10)). Here all people of faith in God are citizens ([Hebrews 12:22–24](https://ref.ly/Heb12:22-Heb12:24)). The Lord has no geographic limits ([1 Kings 8:27](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:27)). So, the true Zion where he lives is in the inner beings of all who worship him.
