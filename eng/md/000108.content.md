## Hope Beyond Judgment (id: 500309)

In the Bible, the prophets often proclaim messages of judgment and doom, but sometimes they also provide hope.

In the prophecy of Jeremiah, the first sign of hope is the Lord's command for Israel reject idolatry and obey the Lord God and the special agreement (the covenant) made at Mount Sinai ([Jeremiah 3:11–4:2](https://ref.ly/Jer3:11-Jer4:2)). If they responded correctly, there would be a positive future for them. They could experience healing salvation ([3:22–23](https://ref.ly/Jer3:22-Jer3:23)). Israel would become a blessing to all nations ([4:1–2](https://ref.ly/Jer4:1-Jer4:2)). The people's repentance would end God's punishment, and the nation would not face destruction. Even during difficulties before the destruction of Jerusalem, God promised a wonderful future that gave hope to the nation (see [16:15](https://ref.ly/Jer16:15); [23:3–8](https://ref.ly/Jer23:3-Jer23:8); [29:10–14](https://ref.ly/Jer29:10-Jer29:14); [30:1–33:26](https://ref.ly/Jer30:1-Jer33:26)).

Even after God allowed the destruction of Jerusalem, he provided hope to the exiles in Babylon. After seventy years, those who obeyed the Lord would return to the promised land to rebuild the temple and Jerusalem. An active community would experience peace and prosperity (see [Jeremiah 46:27–28](https://ref.ly/Jer46:27-Jer46:28); chapters [50–51](https://ref.ly/Jer50:1-Jer51:64)). After Persians conquered Babylon, the Jewish exiles would return to Judah. These events happened in 539–538 BC.

Hope for God's people extended far into the future, as God promised a righteous descendant of King David to rule over his people ([Isaiah 11:1–5](https://ref.ly/Isa11:1-Isa11:5); [Jeremiah 23:5–6](https://ref.ly/Jer23:5-Jer23:6); [33:15–17](https://ref.ly/Jer33:15-Jer33:17)). Jesus Christ is that righteous descendant. Through his death on the cross, he became "the mediator of a new covenant" ([Hebrews 9:13–15](https://ref.ly/Heb9:13-Heb9:15); [12:22–24](https://ref.ly/Heb12:22-Heb12:24)). Those who trust in him now hope for his eternal kingdom beyond God's judgments in this age.
