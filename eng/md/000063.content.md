## Famine (id: 500166)

Famine happened early in the lives of the patriarchs Abraham and Isaac ([Genesis 12:10](https://ref.ly/Gen12:10); [26:1](https://ref.ly/Gen26:1)). When the patriarch Jacob’s family experienced famine, God had already placed his son Joseph in Egypt to help God's people through the crisis ([41:56–42:5](https://ref.ly/Gen41:56-Gen42:5); [45:5](https://ref.ly/Gen45:5), [7](https://ref.ly/Gen45:7)). This famine was very severe. But famines were common in the ancient world (see [Ruth 1:1](https://ref.ly/Ruth1:1); [2 Samuel 21:1](https://ref.ly/2Sam21:1); [1 Kings 18:1–2](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:1-1Kgs18:2); [Haggai 1:1–11](https://ref.ly/Hag1:1-Hag1:11); [Acts 11:28](https://ref.ly/Acts11:28)).

Famine was a terrible disaster in farming societies. Drought, crop failure, or siege could cause it ([2 Kings 25:1–30](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:1-2Kgs25:30)). Famine often came with disease or war, affecting many levels of society ([Jeremiah 14:12](https://ref.ly/Jer14:12)). This included animals ([Joel 1:20](https://ref.ly/Joel1:20)). People relied on rain, so some people stored food to prepare for famine ([Genesis 41:33–36](https://ref.ly/Gen41:33-Gen41:36); [47:23–24](https://ref.ly/Gen47:23-Gen47:24); compare [1 Chronicles 26:15](https://ref.ly/1Chr26:15); [2 Chronicles 31:11](https://ref.ly/2Chr31:11); [Nehemiah 10:37–39](https://ref.ly/Neh10:37-Neh10:39)). 

When there was not enough food, many bad things happened ([Genesis 12:10](https://ref.ly/Gen12:10); [26:1](https://ref.ly/Gen26:1); [2 Kings 6:24–29](https://ref.ly/2Kgs6:24-2Kgs6:29); [Nehemiah 5:1–3](https://ref.ly/Neh5:1-Neh5:3); [Jeremiah 19:9](https://ref.ly/Jer19:9); [Lamentations 2:20–21](https://ref.ly/Lam2:20-Lam2:21); [4:8–10](https://ref.ly/Lam4:8-Lam4:10)). 

* Food became very expensive.
* People stole from each other.
* The poor were treated unfairly.
* Farms could not grow crops.
* People had to leave their homes to find food.
* In the worst cases, people even ate human flesh to survive.

Sometimes, people considered famine as a punishment from God against the Israelites ([Leviticus 26:14–20](https://ref.ly/Lev26:14-Lev26:20); [Deuteronomy 11:16–17](https://ref.ly/Deut11:16-Deut11:17); [28:33](https://ref.ly/Deut28:33); [Jeremiah 29:17–18](https://ref.ly/Jer29:17-Jer29:18)). Therefore, being faithful to God was very important ([Psalm 33:18–19](https://ref.ly/Ps33:18-Ps33:19); [37:19](https://ref.ly/Ps37:19)). God's blessings on the nation included protection from famine ([Ezekiel 34:29](https://ref.ly/Ezek34:29); [36:29–30](https://ref.ly/Ezek36:29-Ezek36:30)).

Jesus experienced a famine similar to Israel's during his time in the wilderness. He chose not to make bread just for himself ([Matthew 4:1–4](https://ref.ly/Matt4:1-Matt4:4); see also [Deuteronomy 8:3](https://ref.ly/Deut8:3)). His success against the devil's temptation showed that lack of food and hunger can build humility and trust in God's care. Jesus fed five thousand people to show them he is "the bread of life," God's "true bread from heaven" ([John 6:32–35](https://ref.ly/John6:32-John6:35)). 

Yet, the crowds followed him more for the food than for who he is ([John 6:26–27](https://ref.ly/John6:26-John6:27)). While not ignoring physical food, Jesus emphasized spiritual hunger and thirst ([Luke 6:21](https://ref.ly/Luke6:21); [John 4:34](https://ref.ly/John4:34)). Eating serves as both a setting and a symbol for fellowship ([Genesis 43:34](https://ref.ly/Gen43:34); [Luke 22:15–16](https://ref.ly/Luke22:15-Luke22:16); [Revelation 19:9](https://ref.ly/Rev19:9)). In heaven, hunger will no longer exist ([Revelation 7:16](https://ref.ly/Rev7:16)).
