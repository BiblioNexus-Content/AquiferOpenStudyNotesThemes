## The Old Life and the New Life (id: 500414)

When people become Christians, they unite with Jesus and share in his death and resurrection. Their old life, marked by sin, ends with Jesus. They start a new life through his power within them (see [Romans 6:3–14](https://ref.ly/Rom6:3-Rom6:14)). 

God transforms them by his Spirit. Their minds are renewed (see [Romans 12:2](https://ref.ly/Rom12:2)). Their desires and actions change, and their lives begin to show his Spirit ([Galatians 5:22–23](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22-Gal5:23)). They begin to spiritually grow and become more like Jesus.

Christians have a duty to be "conformed" to Jesus' death and resurrection (see [Philippians 3:10–14](https://ref.ly/Phil3:10-Phil3:11)). They must turn away from darkness and commit to a life full of light ([Ephesians 4:17–5:20](https://ref.ly/Eph4:17-Eph5:20)). This means they are to stop living in evil ways and start living in God's good ways. The apostle Paul describes this change using the image of clothing. God calls Christians to remove the old, sinful life influenced by the devil and put on a new, pure life guided by the Holy Spirit ([Ephesians 4:21–24](https://ref.ly/Eph4:21-Eph4:24); [Colossians 3:1–15](https://ref.ly/Col3:1-Col3:15); see also [Galatians 3:27](https://ref.ly/Gal3:27)). In doing so, they acknowledge their dependence on God’s grace and power.
