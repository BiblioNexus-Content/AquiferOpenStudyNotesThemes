## Overcoming the Devil (id: 500415)

The New Testament writers believed in the reality of evil and the dangers of the spiritual world. They saw Satan, also known as "the evil one" or "the devil," as a serious threat. The devil blocks the work of God's people (see [1 Thessalonians 2:18](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:18); [Revelation 2:10](https://ref.ly/Rev2:10)). He "prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour" ([1 Peter 5:8](https://ref.ly/1Pet5:8)).

The entire world that does not trust in Christ is under the power of sin and the devil (see [Ephesians 2:2](https://ref.ly/Eph2:2); [1 John 5:19](https://ref.ly/1John5:19)). Paul calls the devil "the god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers" (see [2 Corinthians 4:4](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:4); compare [Matthew 13:19](https://ref.ly/Matt13:19)). Satan opposes God and tries to destroy his people ([Revelation 12:12](https://ref.ly/Rev12:12), [17](https://ref.ly/Rev12:17)). But Jesus came to destroy "the works of the devil" ([1 John 3:8](https://ref.ly/1John3:8)). 

God changes into good what the devil intends for evil. Following this idea, the apostle Paul tells the church at Corinth to remove someone from the Christian community. This way, by encountering the devil's destructive power, that person would repent and find salvation (see [1 Corinthians 5:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:5)).

Christians should submit to God and resist the devil ([James 4:7](https://ref.ly/Jas4:7)). They should pray for God's help ([Matthew 6:13](https://ref.ly/Matt6:13)). They should use the spiritual armor God provides for protection ([Ephesians 6:10–20](https://ref.ly/Eph6:10-Eph6:20)). Those who obey Satan experience consequences (see [Acts 5:1–5](https://ref.ly/Acts5:1-Acts5:5)). Obedient Christians are safe because they know Christ's death on the cross has stopped the devil's power (see [Romans 8:38–39](https://ref.ly/Rom8:38-Rom8:39); [1 Corinthians 15:24](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:24); [Colossians 1:13](https://ref.ly/Col1:13); [2:10](https://ref.ly/Col2:10), [15](https://ref.ly/Col2:15); [1 Peter 3:22](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:22)). 

The Lord protects them (see [1 John 5:18](https://ref.ly/1John5:18)). They also know the Holy Spirit within them is stronger than the devil (see [1 John 4:4](https://ref.ly/1John4:4)). Through God's word, they can defeat the evil one (see [1 John 2:14](https://ref.ly/1John2:14); compare [Revelation 12:11](https://ref.ly/Rev12:11)).

Christians should be cautious of the devil and guard against his influence. But they should not live in fear. God's power is much greater than the devil's. In the end, God will completely defeat the devil (see [Revelation 20:7–10](https://ref.ly/Rev20:7-Rev20:10)).
