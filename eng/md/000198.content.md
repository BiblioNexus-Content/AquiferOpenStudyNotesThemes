## The Blessings of Jesus (id: 500339)

The Beatitudes are the blessings Jesus gave to his followers. They get their name from the word *beati* (which means blessed) in the Latin translation of the Bible (the Vulgate). No single word can fully express what Jesus means here. He describes God's special favor toward his people, both physically and spiritually, and the outcomes of living in that favor.

The Beatitudes describe how a follower of Jesus should live and behave. Jesus invites people to follow him as he shares the message of the kingdom with Israel (see also [Matthew 11:6](https://ref.ly/Matt11:6); [13:16](https://ref.ly/Matt13:16); [16:17](https://ref.ly/Matt16:17); [24:46](https://ref.ly/Matt24:46)). Those who Jesus blesses have repented from their sins in response to the kingdom's message ([Matthew 4:17–22](https://ref.ly/Matt4:17-Matt4:22)). The Beatitudes relate to [Isaiah 61:1–3\.](https://ref.ly/Isa61:1-Isa61:3) The Holy Spirit gives power and leads people to share the good news about Jesus. The Holy Spirit blesses the poor, the humble, and the righteous.

In the Bible, the word "blessed" suggests:

* These blessings come from God and show his approval (see [Matthew 25:34](https://ref.ly/Matt25:34)).
* The blessings show God's promises coming true (see [Matthew 11:6](https://ref.ly/Matt11:6); [13:16](https://ref.ly/Matt13:16); [16:17](https://ref.ly/Matt16:17)).
* The blessings change things in surprising ways, making life better for those who trust God (see [Luke 1:1–2:52](https://ref.ly/Luke1:1-Luke2:52); [6:20–26](https://ref.ly/Luke6:20-Luke6:26)).
* To receive these blessings, people need to obey God (see [Psalms 1:1](https://ref.ly/Ps1:1), [3–6](https://ref.ly/Ps1:3-Ps1:6); [106:3](https://ref.ly/Ps106:3); [112:1–2](https://ref.ly/Ps112:1-Ps112:2); [119:1–2](https://ref.ly/Ps119:1-Ps119:2); [Proverbs 8:32](https://ref.ly/Prov8:32); [Isaiah 56:2](https://ref.ly/Isa56:2)).

These blessings began when Jesus the Messiah came to earth. Christians can be confident that they will enjoy these blessings fully and forever.
