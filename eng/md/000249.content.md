## The Plagues (id: 500173)

The main purpose of the plagues in Egypt was not to rescue the Hebrew people from Egyptian oppression. If rescue was the goal, one big miracle would have been enough. The plagues intended to show who God is to Israel, Egypt, and nearby nations.

The Israelites likely forgot who God was. They lived for hundreds of years in Egypt, a culture that worshiped many false gods. Whatever they believed about God when they arrived, the Israelites became influenced by pagan views during their time there (see [Exodus 32](https://ref.ly/Exod32:1-Exod32:35)).

The plagues in the book of Exodus showed the Lord's complete power over all creation. These disasters targeted elements that the Egyptians respected and worshiped:

1. *The Nile Turned to Blood* ([7:14–25](https://ref.ly/Exod7:14-Exod7:25)): The Nile River, seen as a god that provided life and fertility to Egypt, turned into a symbol of death.
2. *Frogs* ([8:1–15](https://ref.ly/Exod8:1-Exod8:15)): The Egyptians respected frogs, represented by *Heqet*, the frog\-headed goddess of fertility. They thought she had the secret to life after death. Now, frogs covered the land, bringing the smell of death.
3. *Gnats* ([8:16–19](https://ref.ly/Exod8:16-Exod8:19)): "The finger of God" brought a plague of biting insects from the ground. This showed God's power over *Geb*, the Egyptian god of the earth.
4. *Flies* ([8:20–32](https://ref.ly/Exod8:20-Exod8:32)): The Lord made a clear difference between Israel and Egypt. Swarms of biting flies filled the land and tormented the Egyptians, including Pharaoh. They revered flies as symbols of life from death.
5. *Death of Livestock* ([9:1–7](https://ref.ly/Exod9:1-Exod9:7)): The Egyptians saw cattle as holy, believing they controlled life and fertility. They depicted *Amon\-Re*, Egypt's chief god, as a bull. "The hand of the Lord" struck the cattle, showing his supreme power.
6. *Festering Boils* ([9:8–12](https://ref.ly/Exod9:8-Exod9:12)): God gave the Egyptians painful sores. The Egyptian goddess of healing, *Sekhmet*, could not help them.
7. *Hail* ([9:13–35](https://ref.ly/Exod9:13-Exod9:35)): The Egyptian god *Osiris*, who represented plants, could not stop the Lord from destroying them, because "the earth is the LORD's."
8. *Locusts* ([10:1–20](https://ref.ly/Exod10:1-Exod10:20)): The Lord sent wind to bring locusts, which destroyed the remaining plants. This ended any hope that Osiris could restore Egypt's crops.
9. *Darkness* ([10:21–29](https://ref.ly/Exod10:21-Exod10:29)): The Lord showed total control over *Re*, the sun god and leader of the Egyptian gods, who was seen as the father of mankind. No power in Egypt could oppose the Lord and his plans.
10. *Death of the Firstborn* ([11:1–12:30](https://ref.ly/Exod11:1-Exod12:30)): The Lord took the life of each Egyptian family's male heir, which they valued most. Meanwhile, the Lord saved Israel through the Passover blood sacrifice.

Yahweh showed both the Egyptians and the Israelites that he is the only God.

The plagues are often known as "signs," similar to Jesus' miracles (for example, [Exodus 7:3](https://ref.ly/Exod7:3); [10:1–2](https://ref.ly/Exod10:1-Exod10:2); [John 2:23](https://ref.ly/John2:23); [4:48](https://ref.ly/John4:48); [12:37](https://ref.ly/John12:37)). The plagues demonstrate that worshiping created things leads to God's judgment. In contrast, Jesus' miracles show that God can conquer all deadly aspects of creation. This includes illness, evil forces, unpredictable nature, and even death, through the gift of life.
