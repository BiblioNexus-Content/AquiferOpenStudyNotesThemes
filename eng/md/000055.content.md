## Empowering Leadership (id: 500383)

In [Acts 6:1–7](https://ref.ly/Acts6:1-Acts6:7), the early Christian community experienced a leadership crisis. The Hellenists were Greek\-speaking Jews in Jerusalem. They were upset "because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food" ([6:1](https://ref.ly/Acts6:1)). 

This issue threatened the church's growth and needed serious attention. "The Grecian Jews among them began to grumble" ([6:1](https://ref.ly/Acts6:1)). The apostles wisely identified the problem ([6:2–3](https://ref.ly/Acts6:2-Acts6:3)). They called for the selection of seven men to manage the food program ([6:5–6](https://ref.ly/Acts6:5-Acts6:6)). 

Many believe these seven were the first deacons (see study note on 6:2–6). They agreed on a clear division of labor. The twelve apostles focused on preaching and teaching. The other leaders filled with the Holy Spirit dealt with material needs. The apostles showed strong leadership by listening to the community's needs. This wise approach and united action led to spiritual growth and additional Christians ([6:7](https://ref.ly/Acts6:7)).

The church recognized different gifts and used them for the common good (see [1 Corinthians 12:4–11](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:4-1Cor12:11); [1 Peter 4:10–11](https://ref.ly/1Pet4:10-1Pet4:11)). Every Christian has the chance to participate in some form of ministry. This idea of every Christian serving God is called the "priesthood of all believers" ([1 Peter 2:5](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:5), [9](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:9); [Revelation 1:6](https://ref.ly/Rev1:6); [5:10](https://ref.ly/Rev5:10); see [Exodus 19:6](https://ref.ly/Exod19:6); [Isaiah 61:6](https://ref.ly/Isa61:6); [Revelation 20:6](https://ref.ly/Rev20:6)). While not everyone has the same role, God calls every person to use their gifts in God's service.

God has given the church its leaders, "not lording it over" the people, but to serve the community ([Matthew 20:25–28](https://ref.ly/Matt20:25-Matt20:28); [Mark 10:42–45](https://ref.ly/Mark10:42-Mark10:45); [Luke 22:25–27](https://ref.ly/Luke22:25-Luke22:27); [1 Peter 5:1–4](https://ref.ly/1Pet5:1-1Pet5:4)). Church leaders succeed when they understand the community's needs and identify those whom God has prepared to meet those needs. Good leaders recognize talented people and help them grow, enabling members to use their God\-given gifts ([Ephesians 4:11–12](https://ref.ly/Eph4:11-Eph4:12)).
