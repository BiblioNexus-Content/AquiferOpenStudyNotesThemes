## Speaking (id: 500279)

Some people think words do not cause harm. Scripture offers a different perspective. Words hold the power of "life and death" ([Proverbs 18:21](https://ref.ly/Prov18:21)). 

Proverbs lists many things we say that cause harm:

* lies ([Proverbs 14:5](https://ref.ly/Prov14:5), [25](https://ref.ly/Prov14:25))
* arguments ([Proverbs 26:17](https://ref.ly/Prov26:17))
* insults or curses ([Proverbs 20:20](https://ref.ly/Prov20:20))
* speaking falsely about someone to damage their reputation ([Proverbs 10:18](https://ref.ly/Prov10:18))
* spreading private information about others or unverified stories passed from person to person ([Proverbs 11:13](https://ref.ly/Prov11:13); [18:8](https://ref.ly/Prov18:8))
* excessive or insincere praise given to manipulate someone ([Proverbs 7:21–22](https://ref.ly/Prov7:21-Prov7:22))
* speaking too proudly about oneself ([Proverbs 26:23](https://ref.ly/Prov26:23); [27:2](https://ref.ly/Prov27:2))

The book of Proverbs often emphasizes that foolish people say foolish things. “The woman named Folly” symbolizes these people ([9:13–18](https://ref.ly/Prov9:13-Prov9:18)). She lies and deceives to harm her listeners. Words show the heart's condition ([16:23](https://ref.ly/Prov16:23); [18:4](https://ref.ly/Prov18:4)). 

Someone might hide an evil heart with pleasant words ([26:23](https://ref.ly/Prov26:23)). But true character will eventually appear ([26:24–26](https://ref.ly/Prov26:24-Prov26:26)). Foolish words harm others and eventually hurt the speaker. The tongue is full of wickedness that can ruin your life ([James 3:6](https://ref.ly/Jas3:6)).

In contrast, wise people speak words that give life, as shown by wisdom ([Proverbs 8:7–9](https://ref.ly/Prov8:7-Prov8:9); [10:11](https://ref.ly/Prov10:11)). Wise people use their words carefully and are usually gentle ([17:27–28](https://ref.ly/Prov17:27-Prov17:28); [15:4](https://ref.ly/Prov15:4); [16:24](https://ref.ly/Prov16:24)). Yet, a wise person also knows the right time to speak ([15:23](https://ref.ly/Prov15:23); [25:11](https://ref.ly/Prov25:11)). This person understands that sometimes even harsh criticism is necessary (see [27:5](https://ref.ly/Prov27:5)). The book of Proverbs wisely reminds readers to pay attention not only to what they say but also to how and when they say it.
