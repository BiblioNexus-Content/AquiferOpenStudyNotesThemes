## Making Sense of the Exile (id: 500270)

The kings and people of Israel repeatedly disobeyed God and failed to keep their special agreement (the covenant) with him. As a result, God announced that he would bring the covenant curses upon them (see [Deuteronomy 28:15–68](https://ref.ly/Deut28:15-Deut28:68); compare [Jeremiah 4:13](https://ref.ly/Jer4:13); [Amos 5:11](https://ref.ly/Amos5:11); [Micah 6:14–15](https://ref.ly/Mic6:14-Mic6:15)). God sent the Assyrian and Babylonian armies to carry out this punishment, and many Israelites went into exile (see [2 Kings 24:1–25:21](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:1-2Kgs25:21)). They were forced to leave their land.

The exile of Israel influenced many psalms, impacting their images and themes. 

In [Psalm 89](https://ref.ly/Ps89:1-Ps89:52), the psalmist expresses the sadness, pain, and confusion the Israelites experienced when they were living in exile through questions:

* Has God abandoned David's royal family line ([89:38–39](https://ref.ly/Ps89:38-Ps89:39))?
* How long will God's anger last ([Psalm 89:46](https://ref.ly/Ps89:46))?
* Does God understand human weakness ([89:47–48](https://ref.ly/Ps89:47-Ps89:48))?
* Is God true to his nature ([89:49](https://ref.ly/Ps89:49))?
* Is God fair by not avenging his people ([89:50–51](https://ref.ly/Ps89:50-Ps89:51))?

During and after the exile, God's people had many questions. Some doubted God's ability to rule. Instead of ignoring these doubts, wise readers listen, think about, and study the answers in Scripture.

The final answer came through the Lord Jesus Christ (see [Isaiah 52–54](https://ref.ly/Isa52:1-Isa54:17); [Luke 1:46–55](https://ref.ly/Luke1:46-Luke1:55), [67–79](https://ref.ly/Luke1:67-Luke1:79); [4:18–19](https://ref.ly/Luke4:18-Luke4:19); [Romans 6:6](https://ref.ly/Rom6:6), [16–23](https://ref.ly/Rom6:16-Rom6:23); [Hebrews 12:22–24](https://ref.ly/Heb12:22-Heb12:24)). Yet, those who lived during the exile could only partly imagine a hopeful future. They asked difficult questions and lived without clear answers.
