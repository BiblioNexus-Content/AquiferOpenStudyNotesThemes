## God’s Change of Mind (id: 500211)

The Old Testament describes God 34 times as “changing his mind” or “being sorry” (the Hebrew word *nakham*). What does this mean? Does God relent, feel pity, experience sorrow, or grieve?

One thing is clear: God never repents of sin or moral failure because he is perfect (see [1 Samuel 15:29](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:29); [Numbers 23:19](https://ref.ly/Num23:19)). God may "change his mind" about disaster or judgment that he started. This means God may decide to change his plans in response to:

* when people pray with repentance ([Jeremiah 18:7–10](https://ref.ly/Jer18:7-Jer18:10); [Joel 2:14](https://ref.ly/Joel2:14); [Jonah 3:9–10](https://ref.ly/Jonah3:9-Jonah3:10));
* when a human speaks to God on behalf of others ([Exodus 32:11–14](https://ref.ly/Exod32:11-Exod32:14); [Amos 7:2–6](https://ref.ly/Amos7:2-Amos7:6)); or
* without any clear human involvement ([Judges 2:18](https://ref.ly/Judg2:18); [2 Samuel 24:16](https://ref.ly/2Sam24:16)).

A few times, God regrets something he has already done. For example, God regretted choosing Saul as king ([1 Samuel 15:11](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:11), [35](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:35); compare [Genesis 6:6](https://ref.ly/Gen6:6)). But God is not admitting he made mistakes in the past. He is showing sadness about lives that have gone wrong.

Theologians debate how much God, who is all\-wise and all\-powerful, can "change his mind." In the Bible, when it seems like God changes his mind, it shows a human view of God's actions. Any change that God seems to show is how humans experience God. God is constant in his love, mercy, faithfulness, and holy will. God's power, all\-knowing nature, foreknowledge, wisdom, and holiness do not change.
