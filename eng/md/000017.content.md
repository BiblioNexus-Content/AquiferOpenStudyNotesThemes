## Beauty in Nature (id: 500289)

At the end of God's work of creation, God said that everything he made was "very good" ([Genesis 1:31](https://ref.ly/Gen1:31)). Scripture often considers the beauty and wonder of God's creation, especially in the psalms (see, for example, [Psalm 8:3–4](https://ref.ly/Ps8:3-Ps8:4); [Psalm 104:1–35](https://ref.ly/Ps104:1-Ps104:35)).

Nature and imagery from nature are important in the Song of Solomons (or Song of Songs). The man and woman often express their love in the countryside ([Song of Solomon 2:8–17](https://ref.ly/Song2:8-Song2:17); [4:12–5:1](https://ref.ly/Song4:12-Song5:1); [6:2–3](https://ref.ly/Song6:2-Song6:3), [11–12](https://ref.ly/Song6:11-Song6:12)). This is a place with pleasant smells and private spots. The garden, vineyard, and orchard create intimate and romantic settings. The mystery of nature gives them a simple, yet unfamiliar and exciting, scene for their love. 

The couple uses many nature metaphors to describe each other's physical features and their exciting effects. Their descriptions of each other lead them to use illustrations from God’s creation.

Nature directs people to the creator, showing evidence of his power, goodness, justice, and love (see [Psalm 19:1–4](https://ref.ly/Ps19:1-Ps19:4); [Romans 1:18–20](https://ref.ly/Rom1:18-Rom1:20)). God's desire for redemption, restoration, and new creation is also evident in nature's beauty. Examples include the changing seasons, plant growth, and the birth of children.
