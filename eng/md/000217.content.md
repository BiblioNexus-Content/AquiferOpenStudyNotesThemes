## The Dangers of Sin (id: 500227)

Choosing sin instead of remaining faithful to the one true God leads to disaster. This has been true since the beginning, when Adam and Eve's disobedience brought curses and separation from their first home ([Genesis 3](https://ref.ly/Gen3:1-Gen3:24)). It was also true throughout Israel's history (see, for example, [Numbers 16](https://ref.ly/Num16:1-Num16:50); [Joshua 7](https://ref.ly/Josh7:1-Josh7:26); [2 Samuel 11:1–12:19](https://ref.ly/2Sam11:1-2Sam12:19)). The New Testament gives many warnings about the eternal consequences of not repenting for sinful behavior ([1 Corinthians 6:9–10](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:9-1Cor6:10); [Galatians 5:19–21](https://ref.ly/Gal5:19-Gal5:21); [Revelation 22:15](https://ref.ly/Rev22:15)).

During the late period of the Israelite kingdom, God's people often committed sinful acts. Words like *sin* and *evil* frequently describe the kings of Israel ([2 Kings 3:2](https://ref.ly/2Kgs3:2); [13:2](https://ref.ly/2Kgs13:2), [11](https://ref.ly/2Kgs13:11); [14:24](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:24); [15:9](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:9), [18](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:18), [24](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:24), [28](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:28); [17:2](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:2)). This was true about the kings of Judah as well. They “did evil in the sight of the LORD” ([8:18](https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:18), [27](https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:27); [21:2](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:2), [16](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:16), [20](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:20); [23:32](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:32), [37](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:37); [24:9](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:9), [19](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:19)). 

The northern kingdom of Israel was especially guilty. The Scriptures consistently criticize the kings and people for their lack of faith ([2 Kings 17:16–17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:16-2Kgs17:17), [22](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:22)). The main sin of false worship, started by Jeroboam I, continued in Israel until the end ([10:29](https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:29); [17:21–23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:21-2Kgs17:23); [23:15](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:15)). God gave repeated warnings to the people through his prophets ([17:13](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:13)). He allowed foreign invaders to punish them ([13:3](https://ref.ly/2Kgs13:3), [7](https://ref.ly/2Kgs13:7)). 

The Israelites did not change their behavior ([13:6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs13:6); [17:14–17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:14-2Kgs17:17)). Eventually, God let foreign invaders defeat them and capture their land. The Assyrians took many people away into exile ([17:18](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:18), [20–23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:20-2Kgs17:23)).

The people of Judah were not innocent either. Many of their kings were guilty of serious evil. Judean society became more rebellious, and "lived according to the customs Israel had introduced" ([2 Kings 17:19](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:19)). But God showed repeated kindness (for example, [19:32–36](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:32-2Kgs19:36)). His prophets warned the people ([21:8–15](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:8-2Kgs21:15)). Yet, the people continued to sin, and God judged them again ([21:10–15](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:10-2Kgs21:15); [23:26–27](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:26-2Kgs23:27); [24:1–4](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:1-2Kgs24:4); [25:1–21](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:1-2Kgs25:21)).

When people truly repent, God will graciously forgive them and remove sin's penalty. Yet, it is better to remain faithful to God's commands ([2 Kings 18:5–6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:5-2Kgs18:6); [23:25](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:25); [Psalm 119:9–11](https://ref.ly/Ps119:9-Ps119:11), [33–37](https://ref.ly/Ps119:33-Ps119:37); [2 Timothy 4:7](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:7); [Revelation 2:10](https://ref.ly/Rev2:10)). Then God's blessings can lead to success ([Psalm 112:1](https://ref.ly/Ps112:1); [119:1–2](https://ref.ly/Ps119:1-Ps119:2); [144:15](https://ref.ly/Ps144:15); [2 Kings 18:7](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:7); see also [2 Chronicles 26:4–5](https://ref.ly/2Chr26:4-2Chr26:5); [Proverbs 3:1–10](https://ref.ly/Prov3:1-Prov3:10); [2 Corinthians 3:5](https://ref.ly/2Cor3:5)). God's people should give God priority in their lives ([1 Kings 18:21](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:21), [36–39](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:36-1Kgs18:39); see [Deuteronomy 6:13](https://ref.ly/Deut6:13); [10:12–13](https://ref.ly/Deut10:12-Deut10:13); [Micah 6:8](https://ref.ly/Mic6:8); [Matthew 6:33](https://ref.ly/Matt6:33)). They should pray for God's enduring grace ([Psalm 19:13](https://ref.ly/Ps19:13)). They should let the word of God guide them ([Psalm 119:9](https://ref.ly/Ps119:9); [Colossians 3:16](https://ref.ly/Col3:16); [2 Timothy 3:16](https://ref.ly/2Tim3:16)).
