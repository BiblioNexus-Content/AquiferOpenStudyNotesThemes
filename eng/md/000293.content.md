## What Is Good (id: 500330)

[Micah 6:8](https://ref.ly/Mic6:8), a famous and often memorized verse, answers questions from people who became confused and had lost their moral and spiritual direction.

The people of Israel wanted to know how to please the Lord. In a society full of lies and oppression, they forgot what the Lord considers good. God gave them a clear answer. God does not want people to worship him by just following rules and ceremonies without meaning ([Micah 6:6–7](https://ref.ly/Mic6:6-Mic6:7)). 

Instead, he wants them to do what is right in their relationship with him and with each other. When motivated by love, their actions should show justice, mercy, and humility. God's people should not oppress others but act justly, righteously, and honestly toward one another.

[Micah 6:8](https://ref.ly/Mic6:8) summarizes what God had already told Israel. Humility, faith, and obedience please God. 

God shared this message: 

* with Abraham ([Genesis 15:6](https://ref.ly/Gen15:6); [17:1](https://ref.ly/Gen17:1), [9](https://ref.ly/Gen17:9)),
* with Moses at Sinai ([Exodus 20–23](https://ref.ly/Exod20:1-Exod23:33)),
* through his prophets (for example, [Deuteronomy 6:1–8](https://ref.ly/Deut6:1-Deut6:8); [Hosea 6:6](https://ref.ly/Hos6:6)), and
* through Israel’s wise men ([Proverbs 1:7](https://ref.ly/Prov1:7)).

It pleases God when people live humbly in faith, like:

* Moses ([Numbers 12:3](https://ref.ly/Num12:3)),
* Habakkuk ([Habakkuk 3:17–19](https://ref.ly/Hab3:17-Hab3:19)),
* Daniel ([Daniel 9:1–19](https://ref.ly/Dan9:1-Dan9:19)), and
* Ezra ([Ezra 9:5–15](https://ref.ly/Ezra9:5-Ezra9:15)).

True spirituality and devotion result in:

* doing good,
* seeking justice,
* helping the oppressed,
* defending orphans, and
* supporting widows (see [Exodus 22:21–24](https://ref.ly/Exod22:21-Exod22:24); [23:2–12](https://ref.ly/Exod23:2-Exod23:12); [Deuteronomy 15:4–11](https://ref.ly/Deut15:4-Deut15:11); [24:12–15](https://ref.ly/Deut24:12-Deut24:15); [Nehemiah 5:1–13](https://ref.ly/Neh5:1-Neh5:13); [Jeremiah 22:16](https://ref.ly/Jer22:16); [Daniel 4:27](https://ref.ly/Dan4:27); [Amos 5:7–24](https://ref.ly/Amos5:7-Amos5:24); [James 1:27](https://ref.ly/Jas1:27)).

These actions reflect God’s own character ([Psalm 146:9](https://ref.ly/Ps146:9); [Matthew 11:5](https://ref.ly/Matt11:5)).
