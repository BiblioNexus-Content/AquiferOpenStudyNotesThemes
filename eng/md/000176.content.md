## Salvation in Isaiah (id: 500299)

The prophet Isaiah’s name means *Yahweh is salvation*. He urges people to turn from false saviors to God who is the only true savior and protector. Salvation affects all parts of life, including physical and spiritual aspects. For example, the word *salvation* sometimes appears in the book of Isaiah with *righteousness* to show a peaceful order where injustice, disgrace, and mourning do not exist ([Isaiah 45:8](https://ref.ly/Isa45:8); [51:8](https://ref.ly/Isa51:8)).

Isaiah often shares the gospel (the good news about Jesus) that the Lord will come to help his people (for example, [4:2–6](https://ref.ly/Isa4:2-Isa4:6); [10:24–34](https://ref.ly/Isa10:24-Isa10:34); [40:9–11](https://ref.ly/Isa40:9-Isa40:11)). Although God promised punishment and exile because of the wrongdoing of the Israelites, the Lord would not abandon them. Instead, he would save them. Babylon's power and the suffering and shame of the exile would end. Chapters [1–39](https://ref.ly/Isa1:1-Isa39:8) prophesy this message, while chapters [40–66](https://ref.ly/Isa40:1-Isa66:24) explain it plainly.

Isaiah talks about the salvation God would bring through Jesus Christ. He prophesies "a Branch" from King David's family line who would have the Holy Spirit and bring justice and righteousness ([11:1–5](https://ref.ly/Isa11:1-Isa11:5)). He also mentions God's servant who would suffer for the people's sins ([52:13–53:12](https://ref.ly/Isa52:13-Isa53:12)). Jesus fulfilled Isaiah's prophecies and saved humanity from sin and death.
