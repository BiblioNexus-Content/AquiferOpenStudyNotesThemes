## Darkness and Light (id: 500272)

Darkness
--------

Darkness means there is no light. There was no light until God commanded it to appear. He then separated light from darkness ([Genesis 1:2](https://ref.ly/Gen1:2), [4–5](https://ref.ly/Gen1:4-Gen1:5), [18](https://ref.ly/Gen1:18)). The ninth plague he sent against Egypt was three days of deep darkness, with no light at all ([Exodus 10:21–23](https://ref.ly/Exod10:21-Exod10:23)).

Darkness surrounds God ([Exodus 20:21](https://ref.ly/Exod20:21); [Deuteronomy 4:11](https://ref.ly/Deut4:11); [5:23](https://ref.ly/Deut5:23); [2 Samuel 22:12](https://ref.ly/2Sam22:12); [Psalm 18:11](https://ref.ly/Ps18:11); [97:2](https://ref.ly/Ps97:2)). He lives in thick darkness ([1 Kings 8:12](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:12)and the parallel passage in[2 Chronicles 6:1](https://ref.ly/2Chr6:1)). Thick darkness is beneath his feet ([2 Samuel 22:10](https://ref.ly/2Sam22:10)and the parallel passage in [Psalm 18:9](https://ref.ly/Ps18:9)). We cannot know God unless he reveals himself.

Darkness often represents distress and anxiety. Or it can refer to the confusion and destruction experienced by the evil people ([Genesis 15:12](https://ref.ly/Gen15:12); [Job 12:25](https://ref.ly/Job12:25); [19:8](https://ref.ly/Job19:8); [Psalms 35:6](https://ref.ly/Ps35:6); [107:10](https://ref.ly/Ps107:10), [14](https://ref.ly/Ps107:14); [Ecclesiastes 5:17](https://ref.ly/Eccl5:17); [Isaiah 5:30](https://ref.ly/Isa5:30)).

For Job, darkness meant emptiness ([Job 3:4–6](https://ref.ly/Job3:4-Job3:6)). It symbolized death, a land of shadow and gloom where the dead live, far from daylight ([Job 10:21–22](https://ref.ly/Job10:21-Job10:22); [17:12–13](https://ref.ly/Job17:12-Job17:13); [Ecclesiastes 6:4](https://ref.ly/Eccl6:4)).

Evil often happens in the dark ([Job 24:16–17](https://ref.ly/Job24:16-Job24:17)). But darkness cannot hide anything from God ([Psalm 139:11–12](https://ref.ly/Ps139:11-Ps139:12); [Isaiah 29:15–16](https://ref.ly/Isa29:15-Isa29:16)). Darkness often represents not knowing God's will. Knowing God is "light," so not knowing is "darkness" ([Job 12:24–25](https://ref.ly/Job12:24-Job12:25); [Matthew 4:16](https://ref.ly/Matt4:16); [John 1:5](https://ref.ly/John1:5); [8:12](https://ref.ly/John8:12); [12:35](https://ref.ly/John12:35), [46](https://ref.ly/John12:46); [1 John 1:5](https://ref.ly/1John1:5); [2:8–9](https://ref.ly/1John2:8-1John2:9), [11](https://ref.ly/1John2:11)). 

The Bible often uses “darkness” to describe a sinful or evil way of life ([Proverbs 2:13](https://ref.ly/Prov2:13); [4:19](https://ref.ly/Prov4:19); [Isaiah 5:20](https://ref.ly/Isa5:20); [60:2](https://ref.ly/Isa60:2)). In the New Testament, darkness can also represent living without the truth of God ([Matthew 6:23](https://ref.ly/Matt6:23); [Luke 11:35](https://ref.ly/Luke11:35); [Romans 2:19](https://ref.ly/Rom2:19); [Colossians 1:13](https://ref.ly/Col1:13)). [Isaiah 9:2](https://ref.ly/Isa9:2) speaks of a people living in distress who see a great light (see also [Matthew 4:16](https://ref.ly/Matt4:16);[Luke 1:79](https://ref.ly/Luke1:79)). This light is Jesus himself. In that context, “darkness” refers more to suffering and need than to spiritual ignorance.

A major theme of the Old Testament prophets was the "Day of the LORD," often linked with darkness ([Ezekiel 32:8](https://ref.ly/Ezek32:8); [Joel 2:2](https://ref.ly/Joel2:2), [31](https://ref.ly/Joel2:31); [Amos 5:18](https://ref.ly/Amos5:18), [20](https://ref.ly/Amos5:20); [Zephaniah 1:15](https://ref.ly/Zeph1:15)). The New Testament also connects darkness with judgment ([Matthew 8:12](https://ref.ly/Matt8:12); [22:13](https://ref.ly/Matt22:13); [25:30](https://ref.ly/Matt25:30); [2 Peter 2:17](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:17); [Jude 1:6](https://ref.ly/Jude1:6), [13](https://ref.ly/Jude1:13)).

Light
-----

Light was the first thing God created after the heavens and earth ([Genesis 1:3](https://ref.ly/Gen1:3); see also [1:16](https://ref.ly/Gen1:16)). It naturally symbolizes what is pleasant, good, or cheerful ([Ecclesiastes 11:7](https://ref.ly/Eccl11:7); [James 1:17](https://ref.ly/Jas1:17)). When the Israelites left Egypt, a pillar of cloud and fire gave them light ([Exodus 13:21](https://ref.ly/Exod13:21); [14:20](https://ref.ly/Exod14:20)). It showed them the way ([Nehemiah 9:19](https://ref.ly/Neh9:19)). Light represents the Lord's blessing ([Job 12:22](https://ref.ly/Job12:22); [29:2–3](https://ref.ly/Job29:2-Job29:3); [Psalms 4:6](https://ref.ly/Ps4:6); [18:28](https://ref.ly/Ps18:28); [44:3](https://ref.ly/Ps44:3); [118:27](https://ref.ly/Ps118:27)). God's servants can share this blessing by guiding others to God through their obedience ([Isaiah 42:6](https://ref.ly/Isa42:6); [49:6](https://ref.ly/Isa49:6)). God's light also reveals sin and brings justice ([Psalms 90:8](https://ref.ly/Ps90:8); [Isaiah 51:4](https://ref.ly/Isa51:4)).

The Bible describes God as light ([Psalm 27:1](https://ref.ly/Ps27:1); [Isaiah 60:19–20](https://ref.ly/Isa60:19-Isa60:20); [Daniel 2:22](https://ref.ly/Dan2:22); [1 John 1:5](https://ref.ly/1John1:5)). He "dwells in unapproachable light" (see [1 Timothy 6:16](https://ref.ly/1Tim6:16)). Yet, he guides his followers into the light ([Micah 7:8–9](https://ref.ly/Mic7:8-Mic7:9); see also [1 John 1:7](https://ref.ly/1John1:7)).

Jesus said, “I am the light of the world” ([John 8:12](https://ref.ly/John8:12); [9:5](https://ref.ly/John9:5); [12:46](https://ref.ly/John12:46)). He brought a message from God, but he was also that message ([John 1:1–10](https://ref.ly/John1:1-John1:10)). Those who receive his message and trust in him, He gives "the right to become children of God" ([John 1:9–12](https://ref.ly/John1:9-John1:12)). His light spiritually enlightens them and they come to know God and his salvation ([Matthew 4:16](https://ref.ly/Matt4:16); [Luke 2:32](https://ref.ly/Luke2:32); [Acts 13:47](https://ref.ly/Acts13:47); [26:18](https://ref.ly/Acts26:18)). 

They are “sons of light” ([John 12:36](https://ref.ly/John12:36); [1 Thessalonians 5:5](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:5)). They "walk in the light" ([1 John 1:7](https://ref.ly/1John1:7)). Their actions are like light—by doing what is good and right and true ([Ephesians 5:8–9](https://ref.ly/Eph5:8-Eph5:9)).
