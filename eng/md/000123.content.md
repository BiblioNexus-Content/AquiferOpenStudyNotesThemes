## Job’s Innocence (id: 500256)

Job’s comforters could not accept the idea that any human could be truly innocent ([Job 4:17–19](https://ref.ly/Job4:17-Job4:19); [15:14–16](https://ref.ly/Job15:14-Job15:16); [25:4–6](https://ref.ly/Job25:4-Job25:6)). They believed suffering was a direct result of sin. So, Job must have done something wrong to deserve his fate. Job’s claim to innocence seems to contradict the biblical teaching that "there is no one righteous, not even one… all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" ([Romans 3:10](https://ref.ly/Rom3:10), [23](https://ref.ly/Rom3:23)). Was Job correct in declaring his innocence?

Eliphaz and the others misunderstood Job’s position. When they denied that Job could be right or pure, they were referring to the absolute difference between the Creator (God) and the creature (humans). But Job was not claiming to be completely pure. He admitted he had sinned when he was young ([Job 13:26](https://ref.ly/Job13:26)). And he knew he needed God to forgive his sins and remove his guilt ([14:16–17](https://ref.ly/Job14:16-Job14:17)).

At the same time, Job often stated his honesty and his innocence in his relationship with God ([Job 13:14–18](https://ref.ly/Job13:14-Job13:18); [23:10–12](https://ref.ly/Job23:10-Job23:12); [27:3–6](https://ref.ly/Job27:3-Job27:6); [31:1–40](https://ref.ly/Job31:1-Job31:40)). Even Eliphaz admitted that Job lived an upright life ([4:6](https://ref.ly/Job4:6)). Job’s faith led him to seek an audience with God, believing in God's justice despite his suffering. Job continued to hope for a Redeemer ([19:25](https://ref.ly/Job19:25)). 

God's justice might require a mediator, and it might not be clear before death ([Job 9:33–35](https://ref.ly/Job9:33-Job9:35); [19:26](https://ref.ly/Job19:26)). But Job trusted that he would be proven innocent. He lived "by faith, not by sight" ([2 Corinthians 5:7](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:7); see also [Romans 8:24](https://ref.ly/Rom8:24); [1 Corinthians 13:12](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:12); [2 Corinthians 4:18](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:18); [Hebrews 11:1–2](https://ref.ly/Heb11:1-Heb11:2); [1 Peter 1:6–8](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:6-1Pet1:8)).

When compared to the perfect righteousness of Jesus Christ, Job is a sinner like all of us. Job was not made right with God by his own deeds but by his faith in God. On that basis, God declared Job to be "blameless and upright, fearing God and shunning evil" ([Job 1:1](https://ref.ly/Job1:1), [8](https://ref.ly/Job1:8); [2:3](https://ref.ly/Job2:3); [42:7–8](https://ref.ly/Job42:7-Job42:8)). God does the same for us when we, like Job, put our complete trust in him (see [Romans 4:4–5](https://ref.ly/Rom4:4-Rom4:5); [James 2:23](https://ref.ly/Jas2:23)).
