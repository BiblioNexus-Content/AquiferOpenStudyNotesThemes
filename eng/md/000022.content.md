## Bread from Heaven (id: 500186)

When the Israelites left Egypt and entered the wilderness, God provided manna. Manna was a substance like bread that God gave them to eat ([Exodus 16](https://ref.ly/Exod16:1-Exod16:36)). The LORD gave them enough food for their daily needs (see [Nehemiah 9:20–21](https://ref.ly/Neh9:20-Neh9:21)). This "bread from heaven" demonstrated God's love and showed his special care for Israel in the wilderness (see [Deuteronomy 8:3](https://ref.ly/Deut8:3), [16](https://ref.ly/Deut8:16); [Psalms 78:24](https://ref.ly/Ps78:24); [105:40](https://ref.ly/Ps105:40); compare [Revelation 2:17](https://ref.ly/Rev2:17)).

Manna was real food, but some passages use it symbolically. It represents a spiritual relationship with God. It is a sign of God's miraculous provision for his people (see [1 Corinthians 10:3–4](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:3-1Cor10:4)). At the same time, manna relates to Israel's complaints against God and their lack of trust in his provision ([Numbers 11:1–15](https://ref.ly/Num11:1-Num11:15); see [1 Corinthians 10:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:5)).

Jesus miraculously fed about 5,000 men near the Sea of Galilee, in addition to women and children. Then he taught in the synagogue at Capernaum about the “bread of life” ([John 6:22–59](https://ref.ly/John6:22-John6:59)). He called himself the “true bread from heaven” and “the bread of life” ([John 6:32–35](https://ref.ly/John6:32-John6:35)). He even connected eternal life with the need to eat "My flesh and drink My blood” ([John 6:50–58](https://ref.ly/John6:50-John6:58)). Manna provided food in the wilderness. But Jesus is the true bread from God, who offers spiritual food and strength. Israel's need for food humbled them in the wilderness ([Deuteronomy 8:3](https://ref.ly/Deut8:3)). Now, followers of Jesus must humble themselves and receive the fullness of his life by faith ([John 6:35–40](https://ref.ly/John6:35-John6:40), [47–51](https://ref.ly/John6:47-John6:51), [63–64](https://ref.ly/John6:63-John6:64)).
