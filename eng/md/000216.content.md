## The Cross and Passover (id: 500376)

At the start of John’s Gospel, John the Baptist introduced Jesus as "the Lamb of God” ([John 1:29](https://ref.ly/John1:29), [36](https://ref.ly/John1:36)). This phrase might refer to the sacrificial lamb killed daily in the temple ([Exodus 29:38–46](https://ref.ly/Exod29:38-Exod29:46)). Or it might refer to the sacrificial lamb mentioned in [Isaiah 53:7](https://ref.ly/Isa53:7) (see [Acts 8:32–35](https://ref.ly/Acts8:32-Acts8:35); [Revelation 5:5–14](https://ref.ly/Rev5:5-Rev5:14)). Both sacrifices represent rescue and forgiveness from sin.

Yet, this was not all that the apostle John intended. John presented Jesus as the Passover lamb. This lamb's death is the central event of the Passover season (see [Exodus 12:43–47](https://ref.ly/Exod12:43-Exod12:47); [Luke 22:7](https://ref.ly/Luke22:7); [1 Corinthians 5:7](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:7)). 

In the first century, Jews traveled to Jerusalem each spring to celebrate Passover and once again read the story of the exodus from Egypt (see [Exodus 12–15](https://ref.ly/Exod12:1-Exod15:27)). When God rescued Israel from Egypt, the Israelites sprinkled lamb's blood on their doorposts. This act saved those inside each home from death ([Exodus 12](https://ref.ly/Exod12:1-Exod12:51)). Jews who came to Jerusalem for Passover needed to provide a perfect young lamb for sacrifice. The lamb could have no disease or broken bones.

Jesus used his last Passover meal to show that his sacrificial death would give new meaning to the feast ([Mark 14:17–25](https://ref.ly/Mark14:17-Mark14:25)). At his crucifixion, they did not break Jesus' legs, which was often done to fulfill a Passover rule ([John 19:31–33](https://ref.ly/John19:31-John19:33); see [Exodus 12:46](https://ref.ly/Exod12:46)). Blood flowed freely from his wound ([John 19:34](https://ref.ly/John19:34)). This showed that he was giving his life for others. A lamb died to save Jewish families during Passover in Egypt. Similarly, the death of the Son of God on the cross brings salvation to the world.
