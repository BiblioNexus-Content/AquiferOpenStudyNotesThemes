## Returning to the Lord (id: 500333)

The Old Testament prophets often told the people of Israel to return to the Lord, both before and after the exile to Babylon (see, for example, [Isaiah 55:6–7](https://ref.ly/Isa55:6-Isa55:7); [Hosea 6:1–3](https://ref.ly/Hos6:1-Hos6:3); [Haggai 1:12](https://ref.ly/Hag1:12); [Malachi 3:7](https://ref.ly/Mal3:7)). This meant a renewed commitment to obey God. They had abandoned the true God and started worshiping other gods, which led to his judgment. This judgment resulted in the destruction of the temple and their exile. The future restoration and blessing of God's people depended on their obedience to him.

The prophet Zechariah's main message to those returning to Jerusalem from exile is plain in his opening statement: “Return to Me, declares the LORD of Hosts, and I will return to you, says the LORD of Hosts” ([Zechariah 1:3](https://ref.ly/Zech1:3)). Zechariah urged the people of Israel to renew their commitment to their special agreement with God (the covenant). He warned them to learn from their ancestors who were unfaithful to the covenant. This had severe consequences ([7:11–14](https://ref.ly/Zech7:11-Zech7:14)).

Zechariah cared about Israel's covenant with God and social justice. Returning to the Lord leads to obedience and practicing justice, honesty, fairness, mercy, and kindness ([Zechariah 7:9–10](https://ref.ly/Zech7:9-Zech7:10); [8:16–17](https://ref.ly/Zech8:16-Zech8:17)). Zechariah's focus on right relationships with God and others anticipated Jesus' teaching. He said the greatest commandments are to love God above everything and to love your neighbor as yourself ([Matthew 22:34–40](https://ref.ly/Matt22:34-Matt22:40)).
