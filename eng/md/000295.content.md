## Wisdom Psalms (id: 500264)

Some people call certain psalms "wisdom psalms" because they emphasize the importance of wisdom. They guide readers on handling life's questions, issues, and doubts (see [Psalms 1](https://ref.ly/Ps1:1-Ps1:6); [14](https://ref.ly/Ps14:1-Ps14:7); [25](https://ref.ly/Ps25:1-Ps25:22); [34](https://ref.ly/Ps34:1-Ps34:22); [37](https://ref.ly/Ps37:1-Ps37:40); [39](https://ref.ly/Ps39:1-Ps39:13); [49](https://ref.ly/Ps49:1-Ps49:20); [73](https://ref.ly/Ps73:1-Ps73:28); [78](https://ref.ly/Ps78:1-Ps78:72); [90](https://ref.ly/Ps90:1-Ps90:17); [91](https://ref.ly/Ps91:1-Ps91:16); [111](https://ref.ly/Ps111:1-Ps111:10); [112](https://ref.ly/Ps112:1-Ps112:10); [127](https://ref.ly/Ps127:1-Ps127:5); [128](https://ref.ly/Ps128:1-Ps128:6); [131](https://ref.ly/Ps131:1-Ps131:3); [133](https://ref.ly/Ps133:1-Ps133:3); [139](https://ref.ly/Ps139:1-Ps139:24)). Many other psalms include wisdom teachings (see [18](https://ref.ly/Ps18:1-Ps18:50); [27](https://ref.ly/Ps27:1-Ps27:14); [31](https://ref.ly/Ps31:1-Ps31:24); [32](https://ref.ly/Ps32:1-Ps32:11); [40](https://ref.ly/Ps40:1-Ps40:17); [62](https://ref.ly/Ps62:1-Ps62:12); [92](https://ref.ly/Ps92:1-Ps92:15); [94](https://ref.ly/Ps94:1-Ps94:23); [107](https://ref.ly/Ps107:1-Ps107:43); [144](https://ref.ly/Ps144:1-Ps144:15); [146](https://ref.ly/Ps146:1-Ps146:10)).

In the ancient Near East, wisdom involved: 

* maintaining order
* pleasing the gods and others
* observing life, society, and nature

In Israel, wisdom focused on these areas but emphasized "the fear of the LORD." God is the center of life, and fearing him leads to wisdom ([111:10](https://ref.ly/Ps111:10)). "Fear of the LORD" means fully submitting to and trusting in him ([115:11](https://ref.ly/Ps115:11); see also [40:3](https://ref.ly/Ps40:3); [112:7](https://ref.ly/Ps112:7)). This results in a pure life ([19:9](https://ref.ly/Ps19:9)). [Psalm 34](https://ref.ly/Ps34:1-Ps34:22) links the fear of the Lord with a life of plenty.

A life of wisdom means living in a way that pleases God. [Psalm 1](https://ref.ly/Ps1:1-Ps1:6) invites everyone to find joy in God, his teachings, and the way of life that comes from his guidance for wise people. The lives of godly people show inner harmony, growth, and beauty. They reflect God’s righteousness, justice, love, faithfulness, compassion, and grace. They live to please God in both their hearts and their actions.

Wisdom expands a person's perspective on life. A wise person wants to see life from God's perspective. This search involves living with submission and trust under the sovereign king who keeps creation in order and harmony. Seeking God promotes an orderly and peaceful life and encourages obedience ([19:7](https://ref.ly/Ps19:7); [25:12](https://ref.ly/Ps25:12); [51:6](https://ref.ly/Ps51:6); [112:1](https://ref.ly/Ps112:1); [119:98–100](https://ref.ly/Ps119:98-Ps119:100)). 

The wise imitate God, and their lives are joyful even during difficulties. They praise the Lord in all life situations (see [22:23](https://ref.ly/Ps22:23), [25](https://ref.ly/Ps22:25)). They experience life with confidence because the Lord is with them ([23:4](https://ref.ly/Ps23:4); [27:1](https://ref.ly/Ps27:1), [3](https://ref.ly/Ps27:3); [33:18](https://ref.ly/Ps33:18); [91:1–16](https://ref.ly/Ps91:1-Ps91:16)).

The life of the fool, or the evil person, is opposite of the life of the wise. These people see themselves as powerful and always boast about their achievements. They do not accept limits. They brag, oppress, steal, and try to steal others' happiness. They do not fear the Lord ([36:1](https://ref.ly/Ps36:1); [55:19](https://ref.ly/Ps55:19)). The poets of Israel often warned people to avoid the life of a "fool," or God's judgment might come to them ([2:10–11](https://ref.ly/Ps2:10-Ps2:11); [94:8–10](https://ref.ly/Ps94:8-Ps94:10)).

Jesus Christ entered the world as God in the flesh (he is fully God and fully human at the same time). He possesses all the qualities of wisdom. Through him, we can live a life of wisdom ([Colossians 2:2–3](https://ref.ly/Col2:2-Col2:3)).
