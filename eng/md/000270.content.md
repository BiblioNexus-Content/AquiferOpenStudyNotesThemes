## The Spirit’s Presence (id: 500212)

In the Old Testament, the Spirit of the Lord came to people or groups when God gave them a task or chose them for a role. The Spirit empowered judges like Othniel, Gideon, and Jephthah for their duties ([Judges 3:10](https://ref.ly/Judg3:10); [6:34](https://ref.ly/Judg6:34); [11:29](https://ref.ly/Judg11:29)). Saul and David received the Spirit of God when anointed as kings ([1 Samuel 10:1](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:1), [9–10](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:9-1Sam10:10); [16:13](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:13)). 

The Spirit left when the task ended or the person lost their role. When Samuel anointed David as the next king, the Spirit left Saul ([16:13,](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:13) [14](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:14)). This was because he was disobedient and God rejected him as king ([13:7–14](https://ref.ly/1Sam13:7-1Sam13:14); [15:10–29](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:10-1Sam15:29); compare [28:15](https://ref.ly/1Sam28:15); [Judges 16:20](https://ref.ly/Judg16:20)). After David sinned with Bathsheba, he prayed to avoid the same judgment, "take not Your Holy Spirit from me" ([Psalm 51:11](https://ref.ly/Ps51:11)).

In the New Testament, God's Holy Spirit is given to everyone who trusts in Jesus for salvation, not just to those in specific roles (see [Acts 2:14–21](https://ref.ly/Acts2:14-Acts2:21); [1 Corinthians 12:1–13](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:1-1Cor12:13); [Ephesians 1:13–14](https://ref.ly/Eph1:13-Eph1:14)). The Spirit helps God's servants do the work they are called to do (see [1 Corinthians 12:7–10](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:7-1Cor12:10)). The Old Testament story of the Spirit leaving Saul shows why the New Testament warns against sinning against the Spirit and causing him sorrow (see [Mark 3:28–29](https://ref.ly/Mark3:28-Mark3:29); [Ephesians 4:30](https://ref.ly/Eph4:30); [Hebrews 6:1–8](https://ref.ly/Heb6:1-Heb6:8)).
