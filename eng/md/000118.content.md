## Jesus and Satan (id: 500345)

Satan is a personal agent of sin and evil who opposed Jesus ([Matthew 4:1–11](https://ref.ly/Matt4:1-Matt4:11)). 

The Gospel of Matthew refers to this being as: 

* “Satan,” which means *adversary* or *opponent* ([4:10](https://ref.ly/Matt4:10))
* the "devil” ([4:1–11](https://ref.ly/Matt4:1-Matt4:11); [13:39](https://ref.ly/Matt13:39))
* the "tempter” ([4:3](https://ref.ly/Matt4:3))
* the "prince of demons” ([9:34](https://ref.ly/Matt9:34))
* “Beelzebul” ([12:24](https://ref.ly/Matt12:24))
* the "evil one” ([6:13](https://ref.ly/Matt6:13); [13:19](https://ref.ly/Matt13:19))
* “the enemy” ([13:39](https://ref.ly/Matt13:39))

Jesus' mission to announce and bring the kingdom of God on earth led to conflicts with Satan's forces. This included removing demons who possessed people (exorcism) (see [Matthew 8:16–17](https://ref.ly/Matt8:16-Matt8:17); [9:32–34](https://ref.ly/Matt9:32-Matt9:34); [10:1](https://ref.ly/Matt10:1), [7–8](https://ref.ly/Matt10:7-Matt10:8); [12:22–29](https://ref.ly/Matt12:22-Matt12:29); [Mark 5:1–20](https://ref.ly/Mark5:1-Mark5:20)). Matthew notes that Satan has power over kingdoms ([Matthew 4:8–9](https://ref.ly/Matt4:8-Matt4:9); [12:26](https://ref.ly/Matt12:26)). He also commands angels ([25:41](https://ref.ly/Matt25:41)). 

Satan's main method of causing harm is temptation. His purpose is to make people disobey God ([Matthew 4:1–11](https://ref.ly/Matt4:1-Matt4:11); [6:13](https://ref.ly/Matt6:13); [16:23](https://ref.ly/Matt16:23)). As God's agent for human salvation, Jesus encountered strong attacks from Satan ([Matthew 4:1–11](https://ref.ly/Matt4:1-Matt4:11); [John 13:27](https://ref.ly/John13:27)). Yet, Jesus has defeated Satan and will eventually remove all his powers ([Matthew 25:41](https://ref.ly/Matt25:41); [John 12:31](https://ref.ly/John12:31); [Revelation 20:1–10](https://ref.ly/Rev20:1-Rev20:10)).
