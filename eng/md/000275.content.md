## The Theater and Revelation (id: 500444)

In the ancient world, theater was a form of storytelling through live performances with actors, scenes, and dramatic presentations. Understanding the way ancient performances worked can help us understand [Revelation 4–5](https://ref.ly/Rev4:1-Rev5:14). These chapters introduce a divine drama (like a play with scenes and actors) and show the importance of God's agent (the Messiah) in world history. This passage prepares the reader for the main message of the book, which is about the world, the reality of judgment, and the victory that comes through the Lamb (Jesus). In these chapters, a series of scenes (like in a play) is used to communicate the message.

[Revelation 4:1–3](https://ref.ly/Rev4:1-Rev4:3) begins by describing God on his heavenly throne. In ancient theater, a person representing a god sat in a central box or throne high above the stage. This actor explained each scene's importance to the audience with positive and negative comments. Or he resolved script problems too complex for the characters. Similarly, readers of Revelation should look for scenes where God or his messengers interpret or interrupt to explain the message.

The ancient drama developed on the stage beneath the divine figure. Between the stage and the audience, a group of speakers expressed the play's emotions. In Revelation, the four living creatures have a similar role ([Revelation 4:6–8](https://ref.ly/Rev4:6-Rev4:8)). 

The twenty\-four elders represent the old and new covenants ([4:4](https://ref.ly/Rev4:4)). (The "old covenant" refers to the agreement God made with Israel through Moses, which included the Ten Commandments and other laws recorded in the first books of the Bible. The "new covenant" refers to the agreement God made through Jesus Christ, which the New Testament describes as fulfilling the old covenant and establishing a new way of relating to God based on faith in Jesus.) The twenty\-four elders act as a chorus with alternating groups of speakers and provide the historical background for this great drama. They also give the historical context for this great drama. God provides the script, and only his special agent, "the Lamb," can open, read, and perform it ([5:1–5](https://ref.ly/Rev5:1-Rev5:5); [6:1](https://ref.ly/Rev6:1)).
