## Celebration (id: 500216)

God welcomes happy expressions of joy and delight from those who worship and praise him ([Isaiah 30:29](https://ref.ly/Isa30:29); [Jeremiah 30:19](https://ref.ly/Jer30:19); [31:13](https://ref.ly/Jer31:13); [Zephaniah 3:17](https://ref.ly/Zeph3:17); [Ephesians 5:19](https://ref.ly/Eph5:19); [Colossians 3:16](https://ref.ly/Col3:16)).

King David tried two times to bring the ark of God (also called "the ark of the LORD" or "the ark of the covenant") to Jerusalem ([2 Samuel 6:1–11](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:1-2Sam6:11), [12–23](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:12-2Sam6:23)). Both times involved celebration. 

In the second procession with the ark, three Hebrew words describe "dancing" (see also [1 Chronicles 15:25–29](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:25-1Chr15:29)): 

1. *karar* ("danced" in [2 Samuel 6:14](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:14), [16](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:16))
2. *pazaz* ("leaping" in [2 Samuel 6:16](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:16))
3. *raqad* ("dancing" in [1 Chronicles 15:29](https://ref.ly/1Chr15:29))

These words show a lively physical expression, unlike the Hebrew word for "celebrate" used in David's first attempt ([2 Samuel 6:5](https://ref.ly/2Sam6:5)). In the first procession with the ark, David celebrated. In the second, he danced joyfully and celebrated with music, shouting, and trumpets.

Musical instruments were important in temple worship. In [1 Chronicles 25:1–31](https://ref.ly/1Chr25:1-1Chr25:31), David assigned groups to music ministry. Many psalms mention playing instruments to praise and worship God (see [Psalms 33:2–3](https://ref.ly/Ps33:2-Ps33:3); [57:8](https://ref.ly/Ps57:8); [81:2](https://ref.ly/Ps81:2); [92:1–3](https://ref.ly/Ps92:1-Ps92:3); [98:4–6](https://ref.ly/Ps98:4-Ps98:6)). In [Psalms 149](https://ref.ly/Ps149:1-Ps149:9) and [150](https://ref.ly/Ps150:1-Ps150:6), dance and music are combined as a praise offering. In a similar way, music and dancing were present in the father's house in the parable of the lost son ([Luke 15:25](https://ref.ly/Luke15:25)). This was because the son's return was a joyful event.

The book of Revelation describes an eternal celebration for the faithful. This celebration involves worship in God's presence ([Revelation 4:1–11](https://ref.ly/Rev4:1-Rev4:11); [5:8–14](https://ref.ly/Rev5:8-Rev5:14); [15:1–4](https://ref.ly/Rev15:1-Rev15:4)). It is like a wedding feast where the bridegroom (Jesus Christ) and the bride (his church) unite forever ([Revelation 19:9](https://ref.ly/Rev19:9); see also [Matthew 22:1–14](https://ref.ly/Matt22:1-Matt22:14)).
