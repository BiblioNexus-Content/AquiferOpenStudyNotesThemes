## Life After Death (id: 500255)

Writers in the Old Testament describe the place where dead people are as beneath the earth's surface ([Ezekiel 26:20](https://ref.ly/Ezek26:20)). Sometimes, the earth swallows them alive ([Numbers 16:31–33](https://ref.ly/Num16:31-Num16:33); [Psalm 55:15](https://ref.ly/Ps55:15)). But usually, "the cords of death" take them down "and swallows them" ([Psalm 18:4–5](https://ref.ly/Ps18:4-Ps18:5); [Numbers 16:30](https://ref.ly/Num16:30); [Job 24:19](https://ref.ly/Job24:19); [Psalm 49:14](https://ref.ly/Ps49:14); [Isaiah 5:14](https://ref.ly/Isa5:14); [14:11](https://ref.ly/Isa14:11)). In the Old Testament, the afterlife is often considered a gloomy, hopeless place of no return ([Job 7:9](https://ref.ly/Job7:9); [Isaiah 38:18](https://ref.ly/Isa38:18)).

In the book of Job, the main images of the place of the dead include:

* *Sheol*, which is described as dark and dusty ([Job 11:8](https://ref.ly/Job11:8); [14:13](https://ref.ly/Job14:13); [17:13](https://ref.ly/Job17:13), [16](https://ref.ly/Job17:16); [24:19](https://ref.ly/Job24:19); [26:6](https://ref.ly/Job26:6));
* a pit filled with decay (Hebrew *shakhat*; see [9:31](https://ref.ly/Job9:31); [17:14](https://ref.ly/Job17:14); [33:18](https://ref.ly/Job33:18), [22](https://ref.ly/Job33:22), [24](https://ref.ly/Job33:24), [28](https://ref.ly/Job33:28), [30](https://ref.ly/Job33:30)); and
* the grave (Hebrew *qeber*; see [3:22](https://ref.ly/Job3:22); [5:26](https://ref.ly/Job5:26); [10:19](https://ref.ly/Job10:19); [17:1](https://ref.ly/Job17:1); [21:32](https://ref.ly/Job21:32)).

The Old Testament sometimes suggests rescue from the grave (see [1 Samuel 2:6](https://ref.ly/1Sam2:6); [Psalms 16:10–11](https://ref.ly/Ps16:10-Ps16:11); [30:3](https://ref.ly/Ps30:3); [49:15](https://ref.ly/Ps49:15); [56:13](https://ref.ly/Ps56:13); [73:24–26](https://ref.ly/Ps73:24-Ps73:26); [86:13](https://ref.ly/Ps86:13); [139:7–10](https://ref.ly/Ps139:7-Ps139:10); [Isaiah 26:19](https://ref.ly/Isa26:19)). Job hopes *Sheol* might ease his troubles ([Job 3:13–22](https://ref.ly/Job3:13-Job3:22); [14:13–17](https://ref.ly/Job14:13-Job14:17)). He hopes a redeemer might defend him after death ([19:25–26](https://ref.ly/Job19:25-Job19:26)). Yet, only the New Testament fully promises redemption from death ([1 Corinthians 15:50–58](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:50-1Cor15:58)).
