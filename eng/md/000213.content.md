## The Coming of the Spirit of God (id: 500365)

In the Old Testament, the Spirit of God sometimes "came upon" people to give them power for God's work and to prophesy ([Numbers 24:2](https://ref.ly/Num24:2); [Judges 3:10](https://ref.ly/Judg3:10); [1 Samuel 10:10](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:10); [16:13](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:13); [Ezekiel 11:5](https://ref.ly/Ezek11:5)). During Jesus' time, many people believed that the Spirit of prophecy had left Israel after the last Old Testament prophets. Yet, the prophets predicted that when God's salvation came, he would "pour out" his Spirit on everyone ([Isaiah 32:15](https://ref.ly/Isa32:15); [Ezekiel 36:26–27](https://ref.ly/Ezek36:26-Ezek36:27); [Joel 2:28–32](https://ref.ly/Joel2:28-Joel2:32)).

This prophecy first comes true in the birth story of Jesus in Luke's Gospel. The Holy Spirit inspired prophets to witness and guided the events of Jesus' birth. 

The Spirit filled John the Baptist even before birth ([Luke 1:15](https://ref.ly/Luke1:15), [41](https://ref.ly/Luke1:41)). His father Zechariah sang a Spirit\-filled hymn of praise to God ([1:67](https://ref.ly/Luke1:67)). Mary, the mother of Jesus, became pregnant with Jesus and prophesied through the Spirit's power ([1:35](https://ref.ly/Luke1:35); [1:46–55](https://ref.ly/Luke1:46-Luke1:55)). The Spirit led the elderly Simeon to the temple to see the Christ ([2:25–27](https://ref.ly/Luke2:25-Luke2:27)). Later, the Spirit anointed Jesus at his baptism and empowered him to fulfill his role as the Christ ([3:21–22](https://ref.ly/Luke3:21-Luke3:22); [4:1](https://ref.ly/Luke4:1), [18](https://ref.ly/Luke4:18)).

After Jesus ascended to heaven, he fulfilled Old Testament prophecies by sending his Spirit to his disciples on the day of Pentecost. This empowered them to spread the good news (gospel) of salvation worldwide ([Luke 24:49](https://ref.ly/Luke24:49); [Acts 1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8); [2:4](https://ref.ly/Acts2:4), [17–18](https://ref.ly/Acts2:17-Acts2:18)). In the book of Acts, the church completed its mission with the Holy Spirit's guidance, power, and direction. The Spirit's arrival marks the start of a new era of God's salvation. God's presence and power are now within and among his people through the Holy Spirit.
