## John’s Profile of Discipleship (id: 500371)

In the first half of his Gospel, the apostle John describes various people who show true discipleship (see [John 1:19–51](https://ref.ly/John1:19-John1:51); [4:1–42](https://ref.ly/John4:1-John4:42); [9:1–41](https://ref.ly/John9:1-John9:41)). Through these examples, John outlines the qualities of a mature follower, or "disciple," of Jesus.

What are the qualities of a disciple? 

1. *Disciples know who Jesus is.* In each of these three stories, they identify Jesus correctly (see, for example, [John 1:34](https://ref.ly/John1:34), [36](https://ref.ly/John1:36), [38](https://ref.ly/John1:38), [41](https://ref.ly/John1:41); [4:19](https://ref.ly/John4:19), [29](https://ref.ly/John4:29), [31](https://ref.ly/John4:31); [9:2](https://ref.ly/John9:2), [17](https://ref.ly/John9:17), [35–38](https://ref.ly/John9:35-John9:38)).
2. *Disciples trust in Jesus.* They witness Jesus' powerful acts, listen to his wise words, and trust (see [1:49](https://ref.ly/John1:49); [4:39–42](https://ref.ly/John4:39-John4:42); [9:35–38](https://ref.ly/John9:35-John9:38); see also [20:8](https://ref.ly/John20:8), [24–29](https://ref.ly/John20:24-John20:29)).
3. *Jesus’ disciples understand that they must follow him for their discipleship to succeed* ([1:37–43](https://ref.ly/John1:37-John1:43); [8:12](https://ref.ly/John8:12); [10:4–5](https://ref.ly/John10:4-John10:5), [27](https://ref.ly/John10:27); [12:26](https://ref.ly/John12:26); [21:19–22](https://ref.ly/John21:19-John21:22)). "Following" means true devotion, leaving what we have to join Jesus on his journey.

John shared this example of true discipleship to inspire readers to join these brave men and women and become disciples of Jesus too (see [John 20:30–31](https://ref.ly/John20:30-John20:31)).
