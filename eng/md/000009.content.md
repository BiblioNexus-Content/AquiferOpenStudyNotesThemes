## Anger (id: 500280)

Wise people do not get angry quickly. “A patient man has great understanding, but a quick\-tempered man promotes folly” ([Proverbs 14:29](https://ref.ly/Prov14:29)). Anger can cause bad judgment, so wise people think before they act ([14:16](https://ref.ly/Prov14:16)).

The book of Proverbs views anger negatively, but not all anger in Scripture is bad. Many psalms speak of God's anger (for example, [Psalm 77](https://ref.ly/Ps77:1-Ps77:20)). Jesus was angry when he expelled the money changers from the temple ([Mark 11:15–17](https://ref.ly/Mark11:15-Mark11:17); [John 2:13–16](https://ref.ly/John2:13-John2:16)). 

People must learn to tell the difference between righteous and unrighteous anger, though it is often difficult. Unrighteous anger focuses on protecting or promoting oneself (for example, [Genesis 4:3–8](https://ref.ly/Gen4:3-Gen4:8); [1 Samuel 18:8–9](https://ref.ly/1Sam18:8-1Sam18:9); [1 Kings 21:3–4](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:3-1Kgs21:4); [2 Kings 5:11](https://ref.ly/2Kgs5:11); [2 Chronicles 25:10](https://ref.ly/2Chr25:10); [Jonah 4](https://ref.ly/Jonah4:1-Jonah4:11)). Righteous anger shows God’s hatred of evil and love of justice (for example, [Exodus 32](https://ref.ly/Exod32:1-Exod32:35); [Numbers 11:1](https://ref.ly/Num11:1), [10](https://ref.ly/Num11:10); see also [Nahum 1:3](https://ref.ly/Nah1:3); [Romans 9:22](https://ref.ly/Rom9:22)). A wise person understands the situation. Then that person decides if showing anger is appropriate (see also [Proverbs 22:24](https://ref.ly/Prov22:24); [Ecclesiastes 7:9](https://ref.ly/Eccl7:9); [Matthew 5:22](https://ref.ly/Matt5:22); [Romans 12:19](https://ref.ly/Rom12:19); [Ephesians 4:26–27](https://ref.ly/Eph4:26-Eph4:27), [31](https://ref.ly/Eph4:31); [James 1:19–20](https://ref.ly/Jas1:19-Jas1:20)).
