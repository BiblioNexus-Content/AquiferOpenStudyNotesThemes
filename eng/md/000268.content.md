## The Sovereignty of God (id: 500396)

People often think they can control everything that happens in their lives through their own choices and actions. But the Bible teaches us something different. It shows us that God has the highest power and authority over all things (see, for example, [Deuteronomy 4:39](https://ref.ly/Deut4:39); [Psalms 135:5–7](https://ref.ly/Ps135:5-Ps135:7); [Isaiah 46:8–11](https://ref.ly/Isa46:8-Isa46:11); [Jude 1:24–25](https://ref.ly/Jude1:24-Jude1:25)). While our choices and actions have real consequences, God's will (what God wants and plans) is much more important (see [James 4:13–16](https://ref.ly/Jas4:13-Jas4:16)).

God guides and controls everything that happens. We call this the sovereignty of God. God rules over the lives of all people ([Psalm 135:5–12](https://ref.ly/Ps135:5-Ps135:12)). God also controls the entire universe and everything that happens in the world's history ([Isaiah 40:15–17](https://ref.ly/Isa40:15-Isa40:17); [Acts 17:24](https://ref.ly/Acts17:24); [Colossians 1:15–20](https://ref.ly/Col1:15-Col1:20)). God directs everything to his planned outcomes ([Isaiah 46:10](https://ref.ly/Isa46:10); [Daniel 7:27–28](https://ref.ly/Dan7:27-Dan7:28); [Matthew 24:14–31](https://ref.ly/Matt24:14-Matt24:31); [Revelation 1:7–8](https://ref.ly/Rev1:7-Rev1:8)).

In 2 Kings, God shows his power over nations. He chose and removed the kings of Israel and Judah based on His plans and their obedience. He allowed attacks on his people as punishment for their sins ([2 Kings 8:18–22](https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:18-2Kgs8:22)). God was in control when the Assyrians attacked Samaria and defeated the northern kingdom ([17:1–6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:1-2Kgs17:6), [18](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:18), [20](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:20)). King Hezekiah succeeded in Judah because of the Lord’s blessings ([18:5–7](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:5-2Kgs18:7)). God's influence is obvious in the complex international events during the rules of Judah's last kings, as he promised ([23:26–27](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:26-2Kgs23:27)).

God shows his power by answering the prayers and requests of his people. When the Elisha prayed, God answered his faithful prophet. Through Elisha, God allowed the woman from Shunem to have a son and later brought that son back to life ([2 Kings 4:17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:17), [32–35](https://ref.ly/2Kgs4:32-2Kgs4:35)). The Lord kindly answered King Jehoahaz's prayers and sent a rescuer for troubled Israel ([13:4–5](https://ref.ly/2Kgs13:4-2Kgs13:5)). He honored King Hezekiah's prayers for Jerusalem and for his own life ([19:1–7](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:1-2Kgs19:7); [20:1–6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs20:1-2Kgs20:6)).

Paul shows that God decides the path of salvation. Paul often explains the surprising events in salvation history by referring to God's words and actions. Human choices alone cannot explain the situation. God has said, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy" ([Romans 9:15](https://ref.ly/Rom9:15)). Theologians will keep debating God's role and human choice in salvation, but God's control is evident.

Because God is sovereign, his people should try to live in harmony with his will ([Romans 12:1–2](https://ref.ly/Rom12:1-Rom12:2)). They should use the strength he provides (see [1 Corinthians 1:8–9](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:8-1Cor1:9)). We can follow Christ's example in his prayer, “Yet not as I will, but as You will” ([Matthew 26:39](https://ref.ly/Matt26:39)). Today, many people ignore God's influence in human affairs. Yet, God's decisions guide the world and the lives of those who trust him. 

When we live for God's glory, everything that happens is ultimately for our good ([Isaiah 42:8](https://ref.ly/Isa42:8); [Habakkuk 2:14](https://ref.ly/Hab2:14); [Jude 1:24–25](https://ref.ly/Jude1:24-Jude1:25); [Psalm 84:11](https://ref.ly/Ps84:11); [Ephesians 3:16–19](https://ref.ly/Eph3:16-Eph3:19); [Colossians 1:27](https://ref.ly/Col1:27); [2 Thessalonians 1:11–12](https://ref.ly/2Thess1:11-2Thess1:12)). We can confidently say that “God works all things together for the good of those who love Him, who are called according to His purpose” ([Romans 8:28](https://ref.ly/Rom8:28)).
