## The Land (id: 500223)

The land was very important to ancient Israel because agriculture was the main way people made a living. Most Israelites were farmers or herders, and their survival depended on the land’s ability to produce crops and support livestock. 

God gave the Israelites the privilege and responsibility of living in Canaan. This was part of God's covenant with Israel ([1 Kings 8:33–40](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:33-1Kgs8:40); see also [Deuteronomy 28](https://ref.ly/Deut28:1-Deut28:68)). The land was central to Israel’s relationship with God, who promised it to Abraham and his descendants ([Genesis 12:1–3](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:3); [13:14–17](https://ref.ly/Gen13:14-Gen13:17)). The nation of Israel lived as those who tended and owned the land. The land was Israel’s "inheritance" ([Deuteronomy 4:21](https://ref.ly/Deut4:21)). God gave it to them and required their loyalty ([Deuteronomy 4:40](https://ref.ly/Deut4:40)). God expected the people to manage the land well and serve him faithfully.

Sadly, God's people chose their own way to live. They worshiped pagan gods and themselves ([2 Kings 17:7–17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:7-2Kgs17:17)). So, God allowed foreign nations to gradually take Israel's land (for example, [2 Kings 8:20–22](https://ref.ly/2Kgs8:20-2Kgs8:22); [13:1–3](https://ref.ly/2Kgs13:1-2Kgs13:3); [17:3](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:3)). Eventually, Assyria invaded the northern kingdom, sending the Israelites into exile ([17:5–6](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:5-2Kgs17:6), [22–23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:22-2Kgs17:23)). 

Through these events, God warned Judah, the southern kingdom, that they would lose their land if they did not change ([2 Kings 21:8](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:8)). Unfortunately, they did not listen ([21:9](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:9)). Their unfaithfulness led to them being forced out of the land by the Babylonians ([25:1–21](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:1-2Kgs25:7)).

Israel's rebellion and failure to manage the land God gave them is a warning to us. God has redeemed us through Christ Jesus so we can live faithful and productive lives ([John 15:16](https://ref.ly/John15:16); [Ephesians 2:4–10](https://ref.ly/Eph2:4-Eph2:10)). If we are unfaithful and unproductive, we might lose our role in serving Christ ([John 15:1–2](https://ref.ly/John15:1-John15:2), [6](https://ref.ly/John15:6)). By remaining connected to him, we "bear much fruit" and grow in our faith ([John 15:5](https://ref.ly/John15:5)).

God's people always have a tendency to sin (see [Romans 3:23](https://ref.ly/Rom3:23); [1 John 1:8](https://ref.ly/1John1:8), [10](https://ref.ly/1John1:10)). But God is always ready to forgive and restore those who repent and to renew the blessings of his covenant (see [1 John 1:9](https://ref.ly/1John1:9)). Jesus, who mediates the new covenant between God and his people, is also their advocate in heaven ([Matthew 26:27–28](https://ref.ly/Matt26:27-Matt26:28); [1 John 2:1](https://ref.ly/1John2:1)). In the end, those who remain faithful to God will receive the blessings of the new heaven and the new earth ([1 Peter 1:3–5](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:3-1Pet1:5); [Revelation 21:1–7](https://ref.ly/Rev21:1-Rev21:7)).
