## Children and Parents (id: 500283)

Wise children bring great joy to their parents, while foolish children cause them much grief ([Proverbs 10:1](https://ref.ly/Prov10:1); [15:20](https://ref.ly/Prov15:20); [17:21](https://ref.ly/Prov17:21), [25](https://ref.ly/Prov17:25)). This motivates parents to guide their children toward wisdom and encourages children to listen to wise advice ([19:26–27](https://ref.ly/Prov19:26-Prov19:27)).

When children need discipline, parents should not avoid their responsibility, as this can harm the child ([Proverbs 19:18](https://ref.ly/Prov19:18); [22:15](https://ref.ly/Prov22:15); [23:13–14](https://ref.ly/Prov23:13-Prov23:14)). Parents should teach their children about the Lord through their own wise and moral behavior ([Deuteronomy 6:1–25](https://ref.ly/Deut6:1-Deut6:25); [Proverbs 20:7](https://ref.ly/Prov20:7); [22:6](https://ref.ly/Prov22:6)). They should also tell them about God's great acts in history ([Psalm 78:1–8](https://ref.ly/Ps78:1-Ps78:8)). This knowledge will guide children to obedience and blessings. Children should respect their godly parents ([Proverbs 20:20](https://ref.ly/Prov20:20); [30:11–14](https://ref.ly/Prov30:11-Prov30:14), [17](https://ref.ly/Prov30:17)).

Proverbs focuses on the strength and influence of a united family that loves and obeys God. The book strongly warns against those who would harm a family ([Proverbs 6:16–19](https://ref.ly/Prov6:16-Prov6:19); [11:29](https://ref.ly/Prov11:29)). It greatly praises those who strengthen the family (see [14:1](https://ref.ly/Prov14:1)). A family that relies on the Lord can truly thrive ([Psalms 127–128](https://ref.ly/Ps127:1-Ps128:6)).
