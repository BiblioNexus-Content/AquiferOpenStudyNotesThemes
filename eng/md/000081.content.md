## God’s Covenant with Israel’s Kings (id: 500220)

Solomon understood his role as David’s successor ([1 Kings 3:7](https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:7)). The elderly King David advised Solomon to follow all of God's laws from Moses to "prosper in all you do and wherever you turn" ([2:3](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:3)). Solomon's faithfulness would fulfill God's promises to David ([1 Kings 2:4](https://ref.ly/1Kgs2:4); see [2 Samuel 7:5–16](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:5-2Sam7:16)). Early in his rule, he intentionally showed his father's love and faithfulness to God ([1 Kings 3:3](https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:3)). He saw that God had kept his promises to David ([8:23–26](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:23-1Kgs8:26)).

Several times during Solomon’s rule, God communicated the permanent nature of his covenant (special agreement) with David ([1 Kings 3:14](https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:14); [9:4–5](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:4-1Kgs9:5); [11:38](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:38)). God judged Solomon and later kings based on their faithfulness to that covenant compared to David ([11:12–13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:12-1Kgs11:13); [14:8](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:8); [15:3–5](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:3-1Kgs15:5), [11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:11)). God’s approval and blessings or disapproval and judgment depended on whether people obeyed or violated his law (see [Deuteronomy 28](https://ref.ly/Deut28:1-Deut28:68)). 

During the time of the kings, God condemned the people of Israel for intentionally rejecting the Lord's written rules in the law and those spoken by God’s prophets ([2 Kings 17:13–17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:13-2Kgs17:17)). Their rejection of God led to judgment ([2 Kings 17:18–23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:18-2Kgs17:23); [21:11–15](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:11-2Kgs21:15)).

How God dealt with the kings of Israel serves as an example for those in a covenant with God through Jesus. Today, God's people must love Jesus and follow his commandments ([John 14:21](https://ref.ly/John14:21)). They must remain faithful in all things ([Matthew 25:21](https://ref.ly/Matt25:21); [Luke 16:10–12](https://ref.ly/Luke16:10-Luke16:12); [2 Timothy 3:14](https://ref.ly/2Tim3:14); [4:7](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:7)). Those who follow David's example of faithfulness will receive God's praise (see [Acts 13:22](https://ref.ly/Acts13:22)). Those who confess the name of Jesus, David's heir, and are devoted to God and his word will try to live pure and pleasing lives for God ([Acts 13:32–37](https://ref.ly/Acts13:32-Acts13:37); [Hebrews 13:20–21](https://ref.ly/Heb13:20-Heb13:21)). They know they will receive many good gifts from God that will last forever ([2 Timothy 4:8](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:8); [Revelation 2:10](https://ref.ly/Rev2:10); compare [Galatians 5:19–21](https://ref.ly/Gal5:19-Gal5:21)).
