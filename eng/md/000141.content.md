## Miraculous Signs in the Gospel of John (id: 500367)

The Gospels use three words to describe Jesus' miraculous works. In Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the Greek word *dunamis* means "power." It describes an act of raw force that amazes people and makes them realize that God is working through Jesus (see [Mark 6:2](https://ref.ly/Mark6:2)).

The apostle John does not use the popular term *dunamis* for Jesus’ miracles. Instead, he calls each miracle a “sign” (Greek *sēmeion*). This means an event with deeper significance. John also refers to Jesus’ miracles as “works” (Greek *erga*, see [John 10:38](https://ref.ly/John10:38); [7:3](https://ref.ly/John7:3); [9:3](https://ref.ly/John9:3)). Jesus' miracles were part of the work God gave him to do to show the Father to the world ([17:4](https://ref.ly/John17:4)).

John's Gospel records seven miraculous signs during Jesus’ ministry: 

1. Jesus changed water into wine ([John 2:1–11](https://ref.ly/John2:1-John2:11)).
2. Jesus healed an official’s son ([4:46–54](https://ref.ly/John4:46-John4:54)).
3. Jesus healed a paralyzed man ([5:1–17](https://ref.ly/John5:1-John5:17)).
4. Jesus fed five thousand people ([6:1–15](https://ref.ly/John6:1-John6:15)).
5. Jesus walked on water ([6:16–21](https://ref.ly/John6:16-John6:21)).
6. Jesus healded a blind man ([9:1–41](https://ref.ly/John9:1-John9:41)).
7. Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead ([11:1–44](https://ref.ly/John11:1-John11:44)).

John also notes a miraculous catch of fish after Jesus’ resurrection ([John 21:4–14](https://ref.ly/John21:4-John21:14)). Most of these signs led people to trust in Christ ([2:11](https://ref.ly/John2:11); [4:53](https://ref.ly/John4:53); [11:45–48](https://ref.ly/John11:45-John11:48)). 

Yet, Jesus’ goals went beyond the signs. The miraculous signs were like road markers. They pointed to a greater truth. A miraculous sign often comes with a talk from Jesus, explaining the truth it reveals. 

For example, Jesus fed the five thousand men, not just to meet their physical needs. But he showed that he is "the bread of life." He would give himself for them when he died on the cross ([John 6:35](https://ref.ly/John6:35); [6:51](https://ref.ly/John6:51)).
