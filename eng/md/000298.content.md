## Worship in Jerusalem (id: 500328)

The Old Testament prophets understood that true worship requires knowing God and his expectations. God decided that the temple in Jerusalem would be the main place for his people's worship. The Lord's voice came from Zion and Jerusalem ([Amos 1:2](https://ref.ly/Amos1:2)). It was not acceptable for the Israelites to create a central worship site anywhere other than the temple in Jerusalem. 

After the Israelite kingdom split into two parts, Jeroboam, who was king of the northern kingdom, set up new places for worship. He tried to stop his people from traveling to Jerusalem to worship God. Over time, various worship sites appeared in both the northern and southern kingdoms. Yet, no matter how many sacrifices were made or how elaborate the ceremonies were, these were not the places God had chosen for worship ([5:4–5](https://ref.ly/Amos5:4-Amos5:5)).

In the New Testament, worship is not limited to a specific place. Christians can worship wherever they gather (see [Matthew 18:20](https://ref.ly/Matt18:20)). Yet, worship must follow God's guidance "in spirit and in truth" ([John 4:23–24](https://ref.ly/John4:23-John4:24)). Both the Old and New Testaments stress the importance of genuine worship.
