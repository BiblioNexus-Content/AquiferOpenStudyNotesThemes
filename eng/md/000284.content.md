## True Success (id: 500225)

God wants his people to fully commit to him ([Deuteronomy 6:4–6](https://ref.ly/Deut6:4-Deut6:6); compare [Matthew 22:37](https://ref.ly/Matt22:37)). True success comes from seeking God and acknowledging him as the ruler, avoiding all false gods ([Matthew 6:33](https://ref.ly/Matt6:33); [1 John 5:21](https://ref.ly/1John5:21)). For the people of Israel, success depended on their obedience to God’s covenant (see [Leviticus 26:1–46](https://ref.ly/Lev26:1-Lev26:46); [Deuteronomy 28:1–68](https://ref.ly/Deut28:1-Deut28:68)). Israel's spiritual condition and its leaders greatly affected whether they would keep God's favor and remain in the promised land.

The author of 1–2 Kings starts each ruler’s story with a spiritual evaluation. This often compares each king’s devotion to God with King David's example (see [1 Kings 11:38](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:38); [14:8](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:8); [15:3–5](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:3-1Kgs15:5), [11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:11)). These books show that the future of Israel and Judah depends on their kings' spiritual leadership. God's people could only succeed in Canaan if they worshipped God faithfully (see [Deuteronomy 12:4–7](https://ref.ly/Deut12:4-Deut12:7)). The text often criticizes worship of false gods in local places (see, for example, [3:2–4](https://ref.ly/1Kgs3:2-1Kgs3:4); [11:7](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:7)).

Starting with King Jeroboam I, the kings of Israel (the northern kingdom) consistently practiced false religion and Scripture criticizes them for it ([1 Kings 12:31–32](https://ref.ly/1Kgs12:31-1Kgs12:32); [13:33–34](https://ref.ly/1Kgs13:33-1Kgs13:34); [15:25–26](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:25-1Kgs15:26), [33–34](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:33-1Kgs15:34); [16:11–13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:11-1Kgs16:13), [25–26](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:25-1Kgs16:26)). Among these kings, King Ahab was the most evil ([16:30–33](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:30-1Kgs16:33); [21:25–26](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:25-1Kgs21:26)). His son Ahaziah followed his example and God condemned him for his worship of false gods ([22:51–53](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:51-1Kgs22:53)). 

The kings of the northern kingdom led their people toward certain exile ([2 Kings 17:21–23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:21-2Kgs17:23)). Despite God's repeated attempts to gain their attention, they did not listen ([2 Kings 17:13–15](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:13-2Kgs17:15), [23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:23)). So God gave them the consequences for continuous spiritual unfaithfulness (see [1 Kings 13:33–34](https://ref.ly/1Kgs13:33-1Kgs13:34)).

Some kings of Judah (the southern kingdom) receive praise, but Scripture criticizes many of them. Rehoboam allowed worship of false gods to spread in Judah ([1 Kings 14:22–24](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:22-1Kgs14:24)). Abijam continued his father’s sins ([15:3](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:3)). Scripture even criticizes the good kings Asa and Jehoshaphat for allowing popular local worship sites to remain (see [15:14](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:14); [22:43](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:43)). Failing to give God his rightful place led to disastrous results.

The kings and people of the northern kingdom were stupid for doing what they wanted. Yet, the Lord will bless and give true happiness to those who respect and live by his commands ([Psalms 33:12](https://ref.ly/Ps33:12); [119:1–2](https://ref.ly/Ps119:1-Ps119:2); [144:15](https://ref.ly/Ps144:15)). True success comes from recognizing and trusting God as the ruler of one's life ([Matthew 6:33](https://ref.ly/Matt6:33)). As shown by Jesus and his early followers, success does not always mean having material wealth. Joy and peace come from living by God's will and trusting in him (see [Philippians 3:8–14](https://ref.ly/Phil3:8-Phil3:14); [1 Peter 4:12–19](https://ref.ly/1Pet4:12-1Pet4:19)).
