## Wisdom (id: 500277)

Wisdom helps us know how to speak and act in various situations. It allows us to avoid problems and manage them when they happen. Wisdom is more than just intelligence. Proverbs mentions that even animals like ants, rock badgers, locusts, and lizards are wise ([Proverbs 30:24–28](https://ref.ly/Prov30:24-Prov30:28)). They are not wise because of great intelligence but because they know how to live skillfully.

The foundation of wisdom is God. No wisdom exists without "the fear of the LORD" ([Proverbs 1:7](https://ref.ly/Prov1:7)). Wisdom is connected to righteousness and avoids evil. 

According to Proverbs, people gain wisdom by: 

* Observing and experiencing life ([6:6–8](https://ref.ly/Prov6:6-Prov6:8))
* Learning from traditional teachings ([22:17–21](https://ref.ly/Prov22:17-Prov22:21))
* Understanding mistakes ([12:1](https://ref.ly/Prov12:1))
* Most importantly, through revelation from God (see [1:7](https://ref.ly/Prov1:7))

In [1 Corinthians 1–2](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:1-1Cor2:16), the apostle Paul compares the world's "wisdom," which he calls "foolishness," with the wisdom of Jesus Christ. Paul also says about Jesus, “in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” ([Colossians 2:3](https://ref.ly/Col2:3)). God's wisdom shows in Christians' lives through their goodness, humility, purity, and peace ([James 3:13–18](https://ref.ly/Jas3:13-Jas3:18)).
