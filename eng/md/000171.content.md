## Retribution (id: 500155)

God gave humans the task of having children and taking care of the world ([Genesis 1:28](https://ref.ly/Gen1:28)). Yet, as the population increased, so did spiritual evil, violence, and murder ([4:8](https://ref.ly/Gen4:8), [23](https://ref.ly/Gen4:23); [6:5](https://ref.ly/Gen6:5), [11–13](https://ref.ly/Gen6:11-Gen6:13)). This led to a corrupt world that required cleansing.

The purpose of the great flood during the time of Noah was to cleanse the world and retribution against those who did wrong. *Retribution* means "giving what is due" and usually refers to a penalty for bad actions. Retribution comes from the belief that the world has a moral order, which must be maintained or restored (see [Psalm 7:14–16](https://ref.ly/Ps7:14-Ps7:16); [Proverbs 11:17–21](https://ref.ly/Prov11:17-Prov11:21); [26:27](https://ref.ly/Prov26:27)).

God keeps moral order by giving justice, punishing evil actions, and rewarding good behavior ([Galatians 6:7–8](https://ref.ly/Gal6:7-Gal6:8)). Since God oversees the world, it never becomes totally overcome by moral disorder. People are accountable to God for their actions. 

Some examples of God's justice are:

* The judgment and exile of Adam and Eve from the garden of Eden ([Genesis 3:8–24](https://ref.ly/Gen3:8-Gen3:24));
* Cain’s punishment for killing his brother Abel ([4:10–15](https://ref.ly/Gen4:10-Gen4:15)); and
* The worldwide flood ([chapters 6–7](https://ref.ly/Gen6:1-Gen7:24)).

These events show a God who rules over everything and gives fair punishment as part of his good plans for the world (see also [Numbers 16](https://ref.ly/Num16:1-Num16:50); [Deuteronomy 30:15–20](https://ref.ly/Deut30:15-Deut30:20); [Joshua 7](https://ref.ly/Josh7:1-Josh7:26); [Micah 2:1–3](https://ref.ly/Mic2:1-Mic2:3)).

Retribution is one way God shows his righteousness. It cleanses the world for his kingdom of peace. Through retribution, God announces his rule over all and exercises justice against those who reject his rule or defy his commands ([Deuteronomy 7:10](https://ref.ly/Deut7:10); [Psalm 149](https://ref.ly/Ps149:1-Ps149:9); [Proverbs 15:25](https://ref.ly/Prov15:25); [Micah 5:15](https://ref.ly/Mic5:15); [1 Corinthians 16:22](https://ref.ly/1Cor16:22); [Galatians 1:8–9](https://ref.ly/Gal1:8-Gal1:9); [2 Thessalonians 1:5–10](https://ref.ly/2Thess1:5-2Thess1:10)).

For God's people, retribution acts as his discipline. It intends to restore their covenant relationship with him (see [Isaiah 44:22](https://ref.ly/Isa44:22); [Jeremiah 3:12–14](https://ref.ly/Jer3:12-Jer3:14); [Lamentations 3:19–33](https://ref.ly/Lam3:19-Lam3:33); [Hosea 14:1–2](https://ref.ly/Hos14:1-Hos14:2); [Joel 2:12–13](https://ref.ly/Joel2:12-Joel2:13); see also [Hebrews 12:5–11](https://ref.ly/Heb12:5-Heb12:11)). When God's people experience his discipline, they can respond with hope because God's truth and righteousness will win ([Psalm 58:10–11](https://ref.ly/Ps58:10-Ps58:11)). God will redeem and restore those who trust in him ([Leviticus 26:40–45](https://ref.ly/Lev26:40-Lev26:45); [Hosea 2:2–23](https://ref.ly/Hos2:2-Hos2:23)).
