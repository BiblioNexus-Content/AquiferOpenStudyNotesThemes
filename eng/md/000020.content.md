## Biblical Marriage (id: 500153)

The story of creation portrays God as present with humanity’s first union, set within the sacred space of the garden ([Genesis 2:18–25](https://ref.ly/Gen2:18-Gen2:25)). Biblical marriage is a binding covenant (special agreement) before God. Violating that covenant, such as through adultery, is a sin against both people and God. God is the divine witness who guarantees the marriage covenant (see [Malachi 2:10–16](https://ref.ly/Mal2:10-Mal2:16); compare [Genesis 39:6–9](https://ref.ly/Gen39:6-Gen39:9); [Jeremiah 3:1](https://ref.ly/Jer3:1); [1 Corinthians 6:9–10](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:9-1Cor6:10); [Hebrews 13:4](https://ref.ly/Heb13:4)). Although marriage is only between two people, it is not private. It is publically and legally declared, with community recognition, witnesses, and accountability (see [Leviticus 20:10–12](https://ref.ly/Lev20:10-Lev20:12); [Deuteronomy 22:22](https://ref.ly/Deut22:22); [Jeremiah 29:20–23](https://ref.ly/Jer29:20-Jer29:23)).

Marriage is a metaphor for the LORD’s relationship with his people (see [Exodus 19:3–6](https://ref.ly/Exod19:3-Exod19:6); [20:2–6](https://ref.ly/Exod20:2-Exod20:6); [34:14](https://ref.ly/Exod34:14); [Isaiah 54:5](https://ref.ly/Isa54:5); [Ezekiel 16](https://ref.ly/Ezek16:1-Ezek16:63); [Hosea 2:19–20](https://ref.ly/Hos2:19-Hos2:20)). It is first with Israel and then with the church (see [2 Corinthians 11:2](https://ref.ly/2Cor11:2); [Ephesians 5:21–33](https://ref.ly/Eph5:21-Eph5:33)). A marriage symbolizes something greater. God’s people (Christ’s “bride”) await Christ’s return (the “groom”). Married Christians should live in unity and dignity as they look forward to "the marriage of the Lamb" ([Revelation 19:6–9](https://ref.ly/Rev19:6-Rev19:9)). Christ will live forever with his faithful people in glory ([Revelation 19:7](https://ref.ly/Rev19:7); [21:2](https://ref.ly/Rev21:2), [9](https://ref.ly/Rev21:9)).
