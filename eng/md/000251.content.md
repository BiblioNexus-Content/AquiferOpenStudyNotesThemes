## The Priestly Blessing (id: 500185)

The priestly blessing is a well\-known and beloved passage in the Hebrew Bible ([Numbers 6:22–27](https://ref.ly/Num6:22-Num6:27)). For centuries, worshipers have found comfort in its short yet meaningful lines. This famous text is simple and distinguished.

The priestly blessing calls for the Lord's favor by repeating his name in each request (“the Lord” means *Yahweh;* see study note on Exodus 3:15). Repeating God's name reminds his people of his care and role in their lives. This blessing emphasizes the bond between God and his people and helps them remember from where their blessings come.

Many Old Testament passages talk about blessings from God and people (for example, [Genesis 12:1–3](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:3); [27:1–40](https://ref.ly/Gen27:1-Gen27:40); [Deuteronomy 7:12–15](https://ref.ly/Deut7:12-Deut7:15); [28:1–14](https://ref.ly/Deut28:1-Deut28:14)). The Israelites needed God's blessings, his help and favor, as they prepared to leave Sinai. Modern readers often think of blessings in general terms. But, the Israelites in the wilderness understood them as food, water, health, children, protection from enemies, and settling in the promised land. Throughout the book of Numbers, God provided Israel's practical needs.

The Lord blessed Israel through the words of Aaron and his sons, the priests ([Numbers 6:22–23](https://ref.ly/Num6:22-Num6:23)). Besides their work in the tabernacle (and later the temple), the priests played a key role in Israelite life. For example, the priests helped guarantee justice in the land ([Deuteronomy 17:8–12](https://ref.ly/Deut17:8-Deut17:12)). They supported the king in his duties, following a principle in [Deuteronomy 17:18–20](https://ref.ly/Deut17:18-Deut17:20). Eli the priest comforted Hannah and guided young Samuel's spiritual growth ([1 Samuel 1:1–3:21](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:1-1Sam3:21)). The priests and Levites were active in teaching Israel's spiritual lessons (see, for example, [Deuteronomy 33:9–10](https://ref.ly/Deut33:9-Deut33:10); [Nehemiah 8:9–12](https://ref.ly/Neh8:9-Neh8:12); [Malachi 2:5–9](https://ref.ly/Mal2:5-Mal2:9)).

An important archaeological discovery emphasizes the importance of this ancient priestly blessing. In 1980, excavators found two small silver scrolls in a rock\-cut tomb at *Ketef Hinnom*, southwest of Jerusalem's Old City. Scholars date these objects (amulets) to the late 600s or early 500s BC. After a long and careful process, they unrolled the delicate scrolls and found the blessing from [Numbers 6:24–26](https://ref.ly/Num6:24-Num6:26), closely matching the Hebrew Bible text. 

In ancient times, people sometimes wore such scrolls as symbolic objects (charms), similar to *tefillin* or "phylacteries" or "prayer boxes" (see [Deuteronomy 6:8](https://ref.ly/Deut6:8); [Matthew 23:5](https://ref.ly/Matt23:5)). These small scrolls are the earliest biblical manuscripts and contain the earliest reference to *Yahweh*, the Old Testament name of God, found in Jerusalem. These archaeological finds show the lasting appeal of this brief biblical text.

Many New Testament letters conclude with a blessing for the readers. This blessing is similar to the priestly blessing in Numbers (for example, [2 Corinthians 13:14](https://ref.ly/2Cor13:14); [Hebrews 13:20–21](https://ref.ly/Heb13:20-Heb13:21)).
