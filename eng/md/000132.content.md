## Living for Christ (id: 500416)

The apostle Paul writes from prison, “For to me, to live is Christ” ([1:21](https://ref.ly/Phil1:21)). Why should Christians commit their lives to Jesus Christ?

1. *Christians recognize that they owe everything to Christ.* This includes their salvation. They show their gratitude by committing their lives to his service (see [Romans 12:1](https://ref.ly/Rom12:1)).
2. *Christians accept Christ as their master and Lord*. They obey Christ's guidance in their lives. They understand that they belong to the Lord and do not live only for themselves (see [Romans 14:7–9](https://ref.ly/Rom14:7-Rom14:9); [2 Corinthians 5:14–15](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:14-2Cor5:15)).
3. *Christians now share in Christ’s death and resurrection*. They have "died with Christ" and are "alive to God in Christ Jesus" (see [Romans 6:3–14](https://ref.ly/Rom6:3-Rom6:14); compare [Galatians 2:19–20](https://ref.ly/Gal2:19-Gal2:20)). They have a new identity in Christ ([Romans 8:14–17](https://ref.ly/Rom8:14-Rom8:17); [Ephesians 1:11](https://ref.ly/Eph1:11), [14](https://ref.ly/Eph1:14); [Philippians 3:20](https://ref.ly/Phil3:20)).
4. *Christians* *understand that all valuable things are in Christ.* Worldly things that once seemed important have lost their appeal. Nothing compares to the immense value of knowing Christ ([Philippians 3:7–11](https://ref.ly/Phil3:7-Phil3:11); [Ephesians 1:3–3:21](https://ref.ly/Eph1:3-Eph3:21); [Colossians 1:15–3:4](https://ref.ly/Col1:15-Col3:4)).
