## Rebuilding of Jerusalem (id: 500245)

The wall of Jerusalem held great political, social, and religious importance for the people of Judah (see [Nehemiah 2:10](https://ref.ly/Neh2:10), [19](https://ref.ly/Neh2:19); [4:1–15](https://ref.ly/Neh4:1-Neh4:15); [6:1–14](https://ref.ly/Neh6:1-Neh6:14)). In ancient and even modern times, a city without walls cannot last long. Walls protected cities from invading armies and common criminals. 

By Nehemiah’s time, Jerusalem's walls had been in ruins for over a hundred years, since the city's destruction in 586 BC. The ruined wall was a shameful reminder that God had punished the city, fulfilling the covenant curses due to the people's sins ([Nehemiah 1:2–7](https://ref.ly/Neh1:2-Neh1:7); [2:17](https://ref.ly/Neh2:17)). Rebuilding the wall would show God's blessing and prove that he was restoring the covenant people. Israel’s enemies knew that if they rebuilt the wall, the Jews would gain political power, security, and self\-rule. Therefore, they strongly opposed the rebuilding.

Under Nehemiah's leadership, the people of Judea rebuilt the entire wall in just fifty\-two days during the fall of 445 BC. This quick and successful reconstruction can encourage Christians that with God's help, they can achieve remarkable things (see [Nehemiah 2:18](https://ref.ly/Neh2:18); [4:14–15](https://ref.ly/Neh4:14-Neh4:15), [20](https://ref.ly/Neh4:20); [6:16](https://ref.ly/Neh6:16)).
