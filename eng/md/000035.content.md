## Circumcision in the New Testament (id: 500387)

Circumcision, which is the removal of the male foreskin, was common in the ancient Near East (see [Jeremiah 9:25–26](https://ref.ly/Jer9:25-Jer9:26)). For Jews, it held religious importance as a sign of the covenant (special agreement) God made with the people of Israel ([Genesis 17:9–14](https://ref.ly/Gen17:9-Gen17:14); [Joshua 5:2](https://ref.ly/Josh5:2); [John 7:22](https://ref.ly/John7:22); [Acts 7:8](https://ref.ly/Acts7:8); Sirach 44:20\). They usually performed it on the eighth day after a male infant's birth ([Genesis 17:12](https://ref.ly/Gen17:12); [Leviticus 12:3](https://ref.ly/Lev12:3); [Luke 1:59](https://ref.ly/Luke1:59); [Acts 7:8](https://ref.ly/Acts7:8)). 

The New Testament mentions the circumcision of John the Baptizer, Jesus, and the apostles Paul and Timothy ([Luke 1:59](https://ref.ly/Luke1:59); [2:21](https://ref.ly/Luke2:21); [Acts 16:2–3](https://ref.ly/Acts16:2-Acts16:3); [Philippians 3:5](https://ref.ly/Phil3:5)). Circumcision also became a symbol for renewing a person's relationship with God ([Deuteronomy 10:16](https://ref.ly/Deut10:16); [30:6](https://ref.ly/Deut30:6); [Jeremiah 4:4](https://ref.ly/Jer4:4); [Romans 2:28–29](https://ref.ly/Rom2:28-Rom2:29)). In the late 40s AD, some Jewish Christians wanted gentile (non\-Jewish) Christians to become circumcised ([Acts 15:1](https://ref.ly/Acts15:1), [5](https://ref.ly/Acts15:5); see [21:20–21](https://ref.ly/Acts21:20-Acts21:21); [Galatians 2:4](https://ref.ly/Gal2:4), [11–13](https://ref.ly/Gal2:11-Gal2:13)). But Paul and Barnabas disagreed ([Acts 15:2](https://ref.ly/Acts15:2)). The Church council in Jerusalem decided that gentiles did not need to become circumcised ([15:19–21](https://ref.ly/Acts15:19-Acts15:21), [28–29](https://ref.ly/Acts15:28-Acts15:29)).

Paul insisted that it does not matter if a man becomes circumcised ([1 Corinthians 7:19](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:19)). What matters is faith showing itself through love ([Galatians 5:6](https://ref.ly/Gal5:6)). In Galatians, Paul argued against strong Jewish opponents and stated that everyone joins God's family through faith in Jesus Christ ([Galatians 2:14–21](https://ref.ly/Gal2:14-Gal2:21)). Circumcision is not necessary for God to accept a person ([Galatians 5:6](https://ref.ly/Gal5:6)). Jesus' death on the cross is how sinners enter into covenant with God ([Galatians 2:14–21](https://ref.ly/Gal2:14-Gal2:21)).
