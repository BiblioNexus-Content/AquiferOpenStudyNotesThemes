## The Coming of the Lord as Judge (id: 500437)

The Bible tells us there will be a day of judgment. The book of James provides followers of Jesus with a warning and a promise about that day. James announces the Lord's future coming as Judge ([5:7–9](https://ref.ly/Jas5:7-Jas5:9); see also [Isaiah 26:21](https://ref.ly/Isa26:21); [Micah 1:3](https://ref.ly/Mic1:3)). God, who gave the law, is the "Judge, the One who is able to save and destroy" ([James 4:12](https://ref.ly/Jas4:12)). Those who oppose Jesus Christ and oppress his followers will experience severe consequences (see [James 2:6–7](https://ref.ly/Jas2:6-Jas2:7); [5:5–6](https://ref.ly/Jas5:5-Jas5:6)). 

God will judge followers of Jesus if they do these wrong things:

* if they fail to show mercy ([2:13](https://ref.ly/Jas2:13));
* if they become friends with the world and its values ([4:4](https://ref.ly/Jas4:4));
* if they sin with their words ([4:11](https://ref.ly/Jas4:11); [5:9](https://ref.ly/Jas5:9)); or
* if they live to satisfy evil desires ([4:1](https://ref.ly/Jas4:1), [16](https://ref.ly/Jas4:16)).

God will judge them according to the law that was meant to set them free ([2:12](https://ref.ly/Jas2:12)).

The Lord’s future coming affects our lives now. God already honors the faithful poor and humbles the rich who treat them badly ([James 1:9–10](https://ref.ly/Jas1:9-Jas1:10); [5:2–3](https://ref.ly/Jas5:2-Jas5:3)). Followers of Jesus are already God’s special people as God is restoring all things ([1:18](https://ref.ly/Jas1:18)). James says we should obey "the royal law" of the kingdom of Jesus the Messiah ([2:8](https://ref.ly/Jas2:8)). Followers of Jesus will one day inherit this kingdom ([2:5](https://ref.ly/Jas2:5)).

The return of Jesus might not happen soon. So James encourages Christians to endure and wait patiently for Jesus' return ([James 1:3–4](https://ref.ly/Jas1:3-Jas1:4); [5:7–8](https://ref.ly/Jas5:7-Jas5:8)). They will "receive the crown of life" ([1:12](https://ref.ly/Jas1:12)). And they will gather the rewards of righteousness, which come from a life that is faithful to God ([3:18](https://ref.ly/Jas3:18)).

Since judgment is coming, James commands followers of Jesus to "resist the devil" and "submit" themselves to God ([James 4:7](https://ref.ly/Jas4:7)). We should "mourn" our sin and live with pure intentions and actions ([4:8–9](https://ref.ly/Jas4:8-Jas4:9)). We must help any Christian brother or sister who is moving away "from the truth" toward eternal death ([5:19–20](https://ref.ly/Jas5:19-Jas5:20)). Like the prophet Elijah, we must have faith, and practice prayer and confession ([5:13–18](https://ref.ly/Jas5:13-Jas5:18)). Like Job, we must endure suffering. Eventually, we will understand the extent of God’s kindness and mercy ([4:10](https://ref.ly/Jas4:10); [5:11](https://ref.ly/Jas5:11)).
