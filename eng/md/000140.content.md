## Miracles (id: 500384)

Miracles often happened in the Bible. They were especially common during the time of Moses and the ministries of Elijah, Elisha, Jesus, and his apostles. The Bible does not try to prove miracles. It just reports them. Miracles show God's power over creation and his compassion for human needs. 

Miracles can lead people to believe in God ([John 2:23](https://ref.ly/John2:23)). But true belief requires more than just witnessing a miracle (see [John 12:37](https://ref.ly/John12:37)). Miracles remind us that anything is possible for God ([Mark 9:21–23](https://ref.ly/Mark9:21-Mark9:23); compare [Matthew 19:26](https://ref.ly/Matt19:26); [Mark 10:27](https://ref.ly/Mark10:27); [Luke 1:37](https://ref.ly/Luke1:37); [18:27](https://ref.ly/Luke18:27)).

Jesus performed many miracles during his ministry, including healing the sick, casting out demons, controlling nature, and resurrecting the dead. He showed deep love for people by meeting their needs. Many followed him because of these miracles ([John 6:2](https://ref.ly/John6:2)). Yet, he warned against following him only for the miracles ([John 6:26](https://ref.ly/John6:26)). 

The three greatest miracles related to Jesus are: 

1. His arrival as "the Word" of God in human flesh ([John 1:14](https://ref.ly/John1:14)).
2. His resurrection from the dead ([Matthews 28](https://ref.ly/Matt28:1-Matt28:20); [Mark 16:1–8](https://ref.ly/Mark16:1-Mark16:8); [Luke 24:1–53](https://ref.ly/Luke24:1-Luke24:53); [John 20:1–31](https://ref.ly/John20:1-John20:31); [Acts 1:3](https://ref.ly/Acts1:3); [1 Corinthians 15:3–8](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:3-1Cor15:8); see also [Acts 23:6](https://ref.ly/Acts23:6); [26:8](https://ref.ly/Acts26:8)).
3. The miracle of spiritual rebirth ([John 3:3–8](https://ref.ly/John3:3-John3:8); [Galatians 2:20](https://ref.ly/Gal2:20); [Ephesians 2:8–10](https://ref.ly/Eph2:8-Eph2:10)).

Jesus came into the world to save it and to die for sins, showing God's great love for humanity ([John 3:16](https://ref.ly/John3:16); [Romans 5:8](https://ref.ly/Rom5:8); [8:32](https://ref.ly/Rom8:32); [Ephesians 2:4–5](https://ref.ly/Eph2:4-Eph2:5); [1 John 3:1–2](https://ref.ly/1John3:1-1John3:2)). God resurrecting Jesus from the dead shows his power over death and gives us hope for eternal life ([1 Peter 1:3–9](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:3-1Pet1:9)). Anyone who trusts in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord is reborn as a child of God and receives eternal life ([John 1:12](https://ref.ly/John1:12); [3:36](https://ref.ly/John3:36); [Romans 5:1–2](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1-Rom5:2); [1 John 5:11–13](https://ref.ly/1John5:11-1John5:13)).

The miraculous work of Jesus continued through his followers, as shown in the book of Acts (for example, [Acts 3:1–11](https://ref.ly/Acts3:1-Acts3:11); [5:12–15](https://ref.ly/Acts5:12-Acts5:15); [6:8](https://ref.ly/Acts6:8); [8:6–7](https://ref.ly/Acts8:6-Acts8:7); [9:32–42](https://ref.ly/Acts9:32-Acts9:42); [14:3](https://ref.ly/Acts14:3)). Filled with the Holy Spirit, the apostles and other Christian leaders performed these miracles to show the power and truth of the Christian message ([14:3](https://ref.ly/Acts14:3); see [John 3:2](https://ref.ly/John3:2); [Hebrews 2:4](https://ref.ly/Heb2:4)).
