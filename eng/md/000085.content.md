## God’s Glory with His People (id: 500312)

In ancient Israel, God's glory was especially visible at the main holy places built for him. When the Israelites finished building the Tent of Meeting, "the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle" ([Exodus 40:34–35](https://ref.ly/Exod40:34-Exod40:35)). In a similar way, after they completed the temple and brought in the ark of the covenant, "the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD" ([1 Kings 8:10–11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:10-1Kgs8:11)).

The presence and absence of God's glory is a key theme in the book of Ezekiel. God's glory appears to the prophet Ezekiel while he is in exile in Babylon. This means God's glory was no longer at the temple in Jerusalem. Ezekiel's vision in [Ezekiel 8–11](https://ref.ly/Ezek8:1-Ezek11:25) explains why God's glory left the temple. The prophet sees the terrible acts that had spiritually polluted the temple. Without God's presence, the temple became an empty framework, waiting for destruction. 

God did not leave the temple because the Babylonian army forced him out. He left because of his people's spiritual pollution. Their sin made him leave the land promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For a time, the Lord moved from Jerusalem to Babylon to be a holy place for the exiles there (see [11:16](https://ref.ly/Ezek11:16)).

God would not leave his temple forever. After fully punishing the people, he would bring a small group back to their land and make them holy by his Spirit. This would allow him to live among them in a new holy place ([Ezekiel 37:26](https://ref.ly/Ezek37:26)). The idea of God's glory living among his people forever is central to Ezekiel's vision of their restoration ([43:1–5](https://ref.ly/Ezek43:1-Ezek43:5)).

The glory of God lives among his people fully through Jesus Christ. The apostle John says, “We have seen His glory, the glory of the one and only Son from the Father” ([John 1:14](https://ref.ly/John1:14)). The elderly Simeon saw baby Jesus in the temple and called him “a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to Your people Israel” ([Luke 2:32](https://ref.ly/Luke2:32)). While Jesus lived on earth, his glory was hidden from view. However, something special happened on a mountain called the Mount of Transfiguration. There, for a brief time, Jesus let his closest disciples see his true heavenly brightness and glory ([Matthew 17:2](https://ref.ly/Matt17:2)). 

When dying on the cross, Jesus carried the curse for our sins. In his human nature, Jesus felt abandoned by God ([Matthew 27:46](https://ref.ly/Matt27:46)). But now, Jesus has been given the highest honor and power. God has given him the most important place next to himself, "seated… at His right hand" ([Ephesians 1:19–20](https://ref.ly/Eph1:19-Eph1:20)). Through the Holy Spirit, he promises to remain with us until the end of time ([Matthew 28:20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:20)).
