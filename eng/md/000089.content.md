## God’s Judgment of His People (id: 500228)

The kings of Israel and Judah were very important in the history of the divided kingdom. But the people also influenced events. They followed their wicked rulers ([2 Kings 3:3](https://ref.ly/2Kgs3:3); [17:22](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:22); [21:9](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:9), [11](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:11), [16](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:16)). They stopped obeying God ([12:3](https://ref.ly/2Kgs12:3); [14:4](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:4); [15:4](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:4), [35](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:35); [17:9–11](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:9-2Kgs17:11); [18:4](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:4); [22:17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs22:17)). They took part in the religious practices started by Jeroboam I ([10:28–31](https://ref.ly/2Kgs10:28-2Kgs10:31); [17:21–22](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:21-2Kgs17:22)). They worshiped at pagan shrines (holy places) ([12:3](https://ref.ly/2Kgs12:3); [14:4](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:4); [15:4](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:4), [35](https://ref.ly/2Kgs15:35); [18:4](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:4)).

During this time, the Scripture sometimes describes God's people positively. The people of Judah celebrated when they removed Queen Athaliah and Joash became king ([2 Kings 11:12](https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:12), [18–20](https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:18-2Kgs11:20)). Sometimes, the people helped choose new kings or followed good leaders ([14:21](https://ref.ly/2Kgs14:21); [23:30](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:30); [11:17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs11:17); [18:36](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:36); [23:1–3](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:1-2Kgs23:3), [21–23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:21-2Kgs23:23)).

God continued to warn his people through his prophets ([2 Kings 17:13](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:13)). Yet, the people of both kingdoms continued to rebel against God ([17:14–19](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:14-2Kgs17:19), [22](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:22)). As a result, God judged them as he promised ([17:22–23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:22-2Kgs17:23); [21:10–15](https://ref.ly/2Kgs21:10-2Kgs21:15); [22:17](https://ref.ly/2Kgs22:17); [23:26–27](https://ref.ly/2Kgs23:26-2Kgs23:27); [24:20](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:20); [25:21](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:21)). God acted according to the terms of his special agreement (called a covenant) with them ([Leviticus 26:27–39](https://ref.ly/Lev26:27-Lev26:39)). 

Yet, he still loved his people and wanted to restore them (see [Hosea 11:1–11](https://ref.ly/Hos11:1-Hos11:11)). God always cared for his people. He saved them from Sennacherib ([2 Kings 18:17–19:37](https://ref.ly/2Kgs18:17-2Kgs19:37)). He promised that a small group would thrive again in the land ([19:30–31](https://ref.ly/2Kgs19:30-2Kgs19:31)). The good treatment King Jehoiachin received in Babylon probably renewed hope among the repentant people ([25:27–30](https://ref.ly/2Kgs25:27-2Kgs25:30)). 

God promised to restore his people from exile. He would give them fellowship with him in the land again. He would rule over them through his chosen king, a descendant of David ([Jeremiah 23:3–6](https://ref.ly/Jer23:3-Jer23:6); see also [Isaiah 11](https://ref.ly/Isa11:1-Isa11:16); [Romans 11:5–36](https://ref.ly/Rom11:5-Rom11:36)).
