## By Faith (id: 500435)

Faith is a key theme in Scripture, but many misunderstand it. Some think faith means any kind of spirituality, like saying someone is a "person of faith." Others think it means a strong belief that good things will happen, like a way to become healthy and wealthy. Some think faith means believing without evidence. None of these ideas represent biblical faith.

[Hebrews 11](https://ref.ly/Heb11:1-Heb11:40), one of the most loved passages of Scripture, offers a detailed essay on what it means to live "by faith." It describes faith as taking confident action based on what God has revealed. Throughout the chapter, examples show faith in different life situations. What faith produces can vary. 

"By faith" some people find rescue, achieve success, and receive some of God's promises during their lives. "By faith" others face mockery, beatings, torture, imprisonment, and death. Faith might have a reward sooner or later. But faithful people expect rewards because they trust God's character.

What does it mean to live "by faith?" It means that in different situations, we act on our belief that God "exists and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him" ([Hebrews 11:6](https://ref.ly/Heb11:6)). People who live by faith take confident actions based on what God has shown about his character, intending to do his will in everything.
