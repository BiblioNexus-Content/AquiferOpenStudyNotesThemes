## Christian Suffering (id: 500440)

We should not be surprised when we experience suffering ([1 Peter 4:12](https://ref.ly/1Pet4:12)). Christians who live differently by obeying God should expect the culture to respond with hostility. We should expect mockery, bad treatment, false accusations, and even violence.

God has a purpose for us in suffering. It unites us further to Christ, who suffered before God glorified him ([1 Peter 4:13](https://ref.ly/1Pet4:13); see also [Romans 8:17](https://ref.ly/Rom8:17)). By suffering with Christ, we can be sure of sharing in the glory he has already achieved.

The Letter of 1 Peter emphasizes Christian suffering, especially unfair persecution by those who are against the Christian faith. These themes of suffering are most clearly explained in [4:12–19](https://ref.ly/1Pet4:12-1Pet4:19).

We need to commit to doing what is right when we experience suffering ([1 Peter 4:19](https://ref.ly/1Pet4:19)). Difficulties can often become excuses for sinning. But during difficult times, we must live as good examples by showing love for others. Our loving response to enemies during times of distress can be a powerful chance to share our Christian faith. When we show love and kindness to those who hurt us, others may become interested in our faith.

We should remember during our distresses that it is "God's will" and he is "faithful" ([1 Peter 4:19](https://ref.ly/1Pet4:19)). He controls all of life's circumstances. So we do not need to fear any distress as if it could be outside God's oversight or will.
