## God’s Servant (id: 500297)

In [Isaiah 40–66](https://ref.ly/Isa40:1-Isa66:24), God's servant is very important and appears often. The servant announces a new order of justice and righteousness to the world ([42:3–4](https://ref.ly/Isa42:3-Isa42:4)). He prepares the world for God's arrival ([52:7](https://ref.ly/Isa52:7)).

Who is the Lord’s servant? Isaiah identifies the servant as "Israel," who acts as God’s witness and a "light" to other nations ([Isaiah 41:8](https://ref.ly/Isa41:8); [44:1–2](https://ref.ly/Isa44:1-Isa44:2); [43:10](https://ref.ly/Isa43:10)). Yet, the nation of Israel could not fully complete this mission because it was spiritually deaf and blind, and needed God’s forgiveness ([42:19](https://ref.ly/Isa42:19); [44:21–22](https://ref.ly/Isa44:21-Isa44:22)). Israel failed repeatedly. 

In contrast, God’s servant is faithful and waits for redemption (see [Isaiah 61:1–3](https://ref.ly/Isa61:1-Isa61:3); [62:1–5](https://ref.ly/Isa62:1-Isa62:5)). The servant represents the godly people in Israel. The servant is God’s faithful witness to humanity and opposes idolatrous practices of pagan religion.

The prophet Isaiah describes the servant as obedient and suffering. Jesus Christ fulfilled the idea of the "suffering servant." He was an Israelite who was perfectly faithful and suffered for others. Through his suffering, God's blessings reached many, including other nations (see [Acts 26:22–23](https://ref.ly/Acts26:22-Acts26:23)). 

United with Christ, the apostles shared God's message as God's servants with both Jews and gentiles ([Acts 13:47](https://ref.ly/Acts13:47); [26:14–18](https://ref.ly/Acts26:14-Acts26:18)). All who trust in Jesus share the mission of the "servant." They act as God's servants in the world (for example, [Colossians 1:7](https://ref.ly/Col1:7); [4:12](https://ref.ly/Col4:12); [1 Timothy 4:6](https://ref.ly/1Tim4:6); [2 Timothy 2:24](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:24)).
