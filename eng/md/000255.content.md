## The Purpose of the Judgments (id: 500446)

What is the purpose of God's judgments? Are they meant to bring redemption, or are they just meant to destroy? The judgments in the book of Revelation provide some clues.

At the end of the sixth trumpet, despite all the plagues, people "still did not repent of the works of their hands" ([Revelation 9:20–21](https://ref.ly/Rev9:20-Rev9:21)). Some people will not change, no matter what happens to them, even under pressure.

The tormented people of the fifth trumpet wanted to die instead of turning to God in repentance ([9:6](https://ref.ly/Rev9:6)). Many choose death over admitting their sins.

In the sixth seal, the people asked the rocks to fall on them to hide them from "the wrath of the Lamb" ([6:12–17](https://ref.ly/Rev6:12-Rev6:17)). Their desire to escape judgment shows fear instead of trust in God.

Revelation emphasizes God's final justice and the idea of retribution or pay back ([16:5–7](https://ref.ly/Rev16:5-Rev16:7)). Both Christians and non\-Christians will get what they deserve (see [2:23](https://ref.ly/Rev2:23); [11:18](https://ref.ly/Rev11:18); [14:13](https://ref.ly/Rev14:13); [18:6](https://ref.ly/Rev18:6); [20:12–13](https://ref.ly/Rev20:12-Rev20:13); [22:12](https://ref.ly/Rev22:12)).

The judgments are God's partial response to the prayers of the saints for justice. Judgment happens in God's time, not ours ([6:9–11](https://ref.ly/Rev6:9-Rev6:11); [8:2–5](https://ref.ly/Rev8:2-Rev8:5)).

The judgments, similar to the plagues on Egypt, show that earthly gods and God's enemies lack power ([Exodus 7:8–12](https://ref.ly/Exod7:8-Exod7:12); [12:12](https://ref.ly/Exod12:12); compare [Revelation 13:4–17](https://ref.ly/Rev13:4-Rev13:17); [19:20–21](https://ref.ly/Rev19:20-Rev19:21); [20:9–10](https://ref.ly/Rev20:9-Rev20:10)).

The judgments are part of God's mission and provide a final opportunity to repent ([Revelation 14:6–7](https://ref.ly/Rev14:6-Rev14:7); see [9:20–21](https://ref.ly/Rev9:20-Rev9:21); [16:9](https://ref.ly/Rev16:9), [11](https://ref.ly/Rev16:11), [21](https://ref.ly/Rev16:21)).

God has made it clear that sin is wrong and judgment is coming ([Romans 2:5–11](https://ref.ly/Rom2:5-Rom2:11)). Yet, many people still refuse to repent and accept God's grace ([Romans 1:32](https://ref.ly/Rom1:32)). Even in the final days, when God sends his witnesses to warn about the coming destruction, many will choose to support evil forces. They will celebrate the downfall of God's prophets ([Revelation 11:3–10](https://ref.ly/Rev11:3-Rev11:10)). Those who oppose God and turn away from him he will eventually remove from his presence.

Judgment for disobedience and evil actions is certain (see [Romans 1:18–2:11](https://ref.ly/Rom1:18-Rom2:11)). Yet God patiently waits for people to repent and offers his grace (see [Romans 2:4](https://ref.ly/Rom2:4); [2 Peter 3:8–10](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:8-2Pet3:10)). Therefore, these warnings about judgment can be a chance for change.
