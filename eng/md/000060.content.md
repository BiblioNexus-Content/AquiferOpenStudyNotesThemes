## Faith and Good Deeds (id: 500348)

Jesus did not teach that we are saved by doing good things ("works"). Instead, he taught that we need to be changed on the inside. This change (or conversion) happens when God works in us through his grace. When God changes us, we naturally begin to live differently and obey him. When someone has a real relationship with Jesus Christ, they will do good things as a result (see, for example, [Matthew 7:15–20](https://ref.ly/Matt7:15-Matt7:20); [12:33–37](https://ref.ly/Matt12:33-Matt12:37); [15:15–20](https://ref.ly/Matt15:15-Matt15:20)).

The parable of the sheep and the goats shows how faith and actions closely connect. This link between faith, actions, and God's final approval is a common theme in Jesus’ teachings (for example, [Matthew 7:13–27](https://ref.ly/Matt7:13-Matt7:27); [13:3–9](https://ref.ly/Matt13:3-Matt13:9), [18–23](https://ref.ly/Matt13:18-Matt13:23); [16:27](https://ref.ly/Matt16:27)). For Jesus, actions plainly show faith, which begins with repentance. Repentance is a change of heart and mind that causes a person to stop sinning and become more obedient to God ([Matthew 4:17](https://ref.ly/Matt4:17); see also [3:2](https://ref.ly/Matt3:2), [8–10](https://ref.ly/Matt3:8-Matt3:10); [11:20–24](https://ref.ly/Matt11:20-Matt11:24); [12:38–42](https://ref.ly/Matt12:38-Matt12:42)).

Some misunderstand what salvation by God's grace means. This has created a false distinction between faith and works. Salvation does not come from works alone, but it also includes them (see [Galatians 5:6](https://ref.ly/Gal5:6), [21](https://ref.ly/Gal5:21); [Ephesians 2:10](https://ref.ly/Eph2:10); [5:5](https://ref.ly/Eph5:5); [1 John 1:5–10](https://ref.ly/1John1:5-1John1:10); [Revelation 21:8](https://ref.ly/Rev21:8)). Jesus promises blessings and rewards to those who obey God's will ([Matthew 5:3–12](https://ref.ly/Matt5:3-Matt5:12)). Therefore, righteousness is necessary for those who wish to "enter the kingdom of heaven" ([5:20–48](https://ref.ly/Matt5:20-Matt5:48); [7:21](https://ref.ly/Matt7:21); [22:11–14](https://ref.ly/Matt22:11-Matt22:14); [23:3](https://ref.ly/Matt23:3)). Faith that does not produce works is not saving faith ([James 2:14–26](https://ref.ly/Jas2:14-Jas2:26)).

The apostle James emphasizes being faithful to God and argues that doing good things shows faith ([2:14–26](https://ref.ly/Jas2:14-Jas2:26)). A relationship with God cannot rely only on believing a true statement ([2:19](https://ref.ly/Jas2:19)). True faith leads to actions ([1:22–25](https://ref.ly/Jas1:22-Jas1:25); [2:14](https://ref.ly/Jas2:14)). Faithful actions imitate God, who generously gives good gifts ([1:5](https://ref.ly/Jas1:5), [17](https://ref.ly/Jas1:17); [4:6](https://ref.ly/Jas4:6)). Faith and good works cannot be separated. Like Abraham, good works show that a person has complete faith and is righteous before God ([2:23](https://ref.ly/Jas2:23); see [Genesis 15:6](https://ref.ly/Gen15:6)).

Jesus taught and showed that faith involves doing good works (see [Matthew 5:13–16](https://ref.ly/Matt5:13-Matt5:16)). Paul also emphasized the importance of good works ([Romans 2:6](https://ref.ly/Rom2:6); [Galatians 6:5–10](https://ref.ly/Gal6:5-Gal6:10); [Ephesians 2:10](https://ref.ly/Eph2:10); [Philippians 2:12–13](https://ref.ly/Phil2:12-Phil2:13); [1 Thessalonians 1:3](https://ref.ly/1Thess1:3)). 

James's letter emphasizes specific actions that show faith. These include: 

* Caring for orphans and widows ([1:27](https://ref.ly/Jas1:27))
* Not favoring the rich ([2:1–7](https://ref.ly/Jas2:1-Jas2:7))
* Providing food and clothing for the poor ([2:15–17](https://ref.ly/Jas2:15-Jas2:17))
* Controlling what one says ([3:1–12](https://ref.ly/Jas3:1-Jas3:12))
* Promoting peace ([3:17–18](https://ref.ly/Jas3:17-Jas3:18))
* Not judging others ([4:11–12](https://ref.ly/Jas4:11-Jas4:12))

These actions are "faith expressing itself through love" ([Galatians 5:6](https://ref.ly/Gal5:6)).
