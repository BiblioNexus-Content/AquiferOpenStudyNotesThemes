## The Day Is Coming (id: 500355)

Jesus prophesied three future events in the Synoptic Gospels:

1. One event was his own death and resurrection ([Mark 8:31](https://ref.ly/Mark8:31); [9:31](https://ref.ly/Mark9:31); [10:33–34](https://ref.ly/Mark10:33-Mark10:34)). This had already happened before the Gospels were written.
2. The second event Jesus prophesied was the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 ([Matthew 24:1–28](https://ref.ly/Matt24:1-Matt24:28); [13:1–23](https://ref.ly/Mark13:1-Mark13:23); [Luke 19:41–44](https://ref.ly/Luke19:41-Luke19:44); [21:5–24](https://ref.ly/Luke21:5-Luke21:24)). This event was probably about to happen when Mark wrote his Gospel (see Mark Book Introduction, “Date”). Yet, this event would not mark the absolute end. So the Christian community must continue to live faithfully and be spiritually watching for the return of the Son of God in glory, which could be soon ([Mark 13:34–37](https://ref.ly/Mark13:34-Mark13:37)).
3. The third event Jesus prophesied was his own future return ([Matthew 23:39](https://ref.ly/Matt23:39); [24:3](https://ref.ly/Matt24:3), [29–31](https://ref.ly/Matt24:29-Matt24:31), [24:36–25:46](https://ref.ly/Matt24:36-Matt25:46); [Mark 8:38](https://ref.ly/Mark8:38); [13:24–27](https://ref.ly/Mark13:24-Mark13:27), [32–37](https://ref.ly/Mark13:32-Mark13:37); [Luke 21:25–36](https://ref.ly/Luke21:25-Luke21:36); [John 14:1–3](https://ref.ly/John14:1-John14:3)). The New Testament frequently mentions Jesus' second coming (see, for example, [1 Corinthians 1:7–8](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:7-1Cor1:8); [3:13](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:13); [5:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:5); [2 Corinthians 1:14](https://ref.ly/2Cor1:14); [Philippians 1:6](https://ref.ly/Phil1:6), [10](https://ref.ly/Phil1:10); [2:16](https://ref.ly/Phil2:16); [1 Thessalonians 5:1–11](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:1-1Thess5:11); [2 Thessalonians 2:2](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:2); [2 Timothy 1:12](https://ref.ly/2Tim1:12), [18](https://ref.ly/2Tim1:18); [4:1](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:1), [8](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:8)).

When Jesus returns, God's kingdom promises will come true. Jesus will judge and destroy Satan and his angels ([Romans 16:20](https://ref.ly/Rom16:20); [2 Thessalonians 2:3–12](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:3-2Thess2:12)). Those who refuse to trust in Jesus will experience eternal judgment ([Matthew 13:40–42](https://ref.ly/Matt13:40-Matt13:42); [25:31–46](https://ref.ly/Matt25:31-Matt25:46); [Luke 6:24–26](https://ref.ly/Luke6:24-Luke6:26); [16:19–31](https://ref.ly/Luke16:19-Luke16:31); [Acts 10:42](https://ref.ly/Acts10:42); [Ephesians 5:6](https://ref.ly/Eph5:6); [Colossians 3:6](https://ref.ly/Col3:6); [Hebrews 10:25](https://ref.ly/Heb10:25); [2 Peter 3:7](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:7); [Jude 1:6](https://ref.ly/Jude1:6); [Revelation 1:7](https://ref.ly/Rev1:7); [6:14](https://ref.ly/Rev6:14), [17](https://ref.ly/Rev6:17)). Meanwhile, the faithful will resurrect to enjoy eternal life ([1 Thessalonians 4:13–18](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:13-1Thess4:18)). God will gather his chosen people for salvation ([Mark 13:27](https://ref.ly/Mark13:27); [Hebrews 1:14](https://ref.ly/Heb1:14); [9:27–28](https://ref.ly/Heb9:27-Heb9:28)), grace ([1 Peter 1:13](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:13)), and glory ([1 Thessalonians 2:12](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:12); [2 Thessalonians 2:14](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:14); [1 Peter 1:7](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:7); [5:1](https://ref.ly/1Pet5:1), [4](https://ref.ly/1Pet5:4)). 

He will give his people an endless inheritance and new eternal bodies ([1 Peter 1:4](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:4); [1 Corinthians 15:35–57](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:35-1Cor15:57); [Philippians 3:21](https://ref.ly/Phil3:21); [1 Thessalonians 4:13–18](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:13-1Thess4:18)). God will free all of creation from its curse and transform it ([Genesis 3:17–18](https://ref.ly/Gen3:17-Gen3:18); [Romans 8:20–23](https://ref.ly/Rom8:20-Rom8:23); [2 Peter 3:12–13](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:12-2Pet3:13); [Revelation 21:1–22:5](https://ref.ly/Rev21:1-Rev22:5)). Sorrow, tears, mourning, and death will no longer exist ([Revelation 21:4](https://ref.ly/Rev21:4)). Those who were faithful to Christ in this life "will see God" ([Matthew 5:8](https://ref.ly/Matt5:8); [Revelation 22:3](https://ref.ly/Rev22:3)).

Because of these promises, Christians must pray and wait for his return ([Matthew 6:10](https://ref.ly/Matt6:10); [Revelation 22:20](https://ref.ly/Rev22:20)). We must not try to guess the dates of his coming ([Mark 13:32](https://ref.ly/Mark13:32); [Acts 1:7](https://ref.ly/Acts1:7)). Instead, we must live honorably and stay prepared ([1 John 2:28](https://ref.ly/1John2:28); [Matthew 24:36–25:30](https://ref.ly/Matt24:36-Matt25:30); [1 Thessalonians 5:1–11](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:1-1Thess5:11)).
