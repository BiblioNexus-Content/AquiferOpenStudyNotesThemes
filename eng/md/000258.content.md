## The Resurrection of Jesus (id: 500349)

The Bible clearly describes how Jesus physically rose from the dead through God's power. However, many other explanations have been suggested:

1. Jesus did not actually die. He fainted and later woke up in a cold tomb. Some call this the "the swoon theory."
2. Jesus' disciples stole his body and lied about the resurrection (see [Matthew 28:12–15](https://ref.ly/Matt28:12-Matt28:15)).
3. The disciples saw things that were not there (called hallucinations) and had dreams, causing them to confuse these experiences with a physical resurrection.
4. The resurrection is a personal faith experience, not a historical event.

These ideas often come from doubt about supernatural or miraculous events. They overlook that for New Testament writers and their audiences, the term *resurrection* meant an actual dead body coming back to life (see [1 Corinthians 15](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:1-1Cor15:58)).

There is historical evidence for Jesus' resurrection. The biblical accounts are reliable as well. These proofs include: 

1. The empty tomb.
2. Women as witnesses, which was unusual at that time. This is because people then considered women's testimony less reliable than men's.
3. The consistent accounts of Jesus' appearances after his resurrection.
4. How the disciples transformed from fearful to fearless followers.
5. The disciples' ability to accept the shame of following the religion of a crucified man. According to [Deuteronomy 21:23](https://ref.ly/Deut21:23), such a death meant being under God's curse.

Judaism had no concept of a Messiah (God's chosen one) who would die and then rise again that could easily be applied to Jesus. Creating a story that no one would find believable would not have made sense. The most reasonable conclusion is exactly what the New Testament declares: Jesus did rise from the dead.
