## Hardened Hearts (id: 500168)

The book of Exodus often mentions that the Lord caused Pharaoh to act stubborn or "hardened Pharaoh's heart" ([Exodus 4:21](https://ref.ly/Exod4:21); [9:12](https://ref.ly/Exod9:12); [10:1](https://ref.ly/Exod10:1), [20](https://ref.ly/Exod10:20); [11:10](https://ref.ly/Exod11:10); [14:4](https://ref.ly/Exod14:4), [8](https://ref.ly/Exod14:8)). These statements can be difficult. Did God make Pharaoh sin?

These factors are important to consider: 

1. The Lord knew Pharaoh would be stubborn ([3:19](https://ref.ly/Exod3:19)).
2. Pharaoh himself became stubborn ([8:15](https://ref.ly/Exod8:15), [32](https://ref.ly/Exod8:32)).
3. Pharaoh stayed stubborn despite clear warnings ([8:19](https://ref.ly/Exod8:19)).

Pharaoh was not a well\-meaning person, simply misguided and not allowed to repent. Although God controlled the situation, Pharaoh was responsible for his actions.

This interaction between human choice and divine control (God's sovereignty) appears in other parts of Scripture. The Israelites became stubborn and did not trust God in the wilderness ([Psalm 95:8–10](https://ref.ly/Ps95:8-Ps95:10)). God hardened the hearts of the Canaanites, so they did not seek peace with the Hebrews ([Joshua 11:20](https://ref.ly/Josh11:20)). The message God gave to the prophet Isaiah caused his listeners to become stubborn ([Isaiah 6:9–10](https://ref.ly/Isa6:9-Isa6:10)). 

In a similar way, in the New Testament, many people stubbornly refused to respond with faith to the good news about Jesus ([Matthew 13:15](https://ref.ly/Matt13:15); [John 12:40](https://ref.ly/John12:40); [Acts 28:27](https://ref.ly/Acts28:27)). People are responsible for their choices, but they do not make them in isolation. They make choices within the world God created and guides.

The book of Exodus emphasizes God's control over Pharaoh. It shows a clear contrast between two belief systems. Pharaoh thought he was a god and could do anything he wanted. But God proved this was not true. Like all created beings, Pharaoh's choices were limited. God showed that only he is truly independent. The Lord is the eternal "I Am" (see [3:6–14](https://ref.ly/Exod3:6-Exod3:14); [6:2–8](https://ref.ly/Exod6:2-Exod6:8); [20:2](https://ref.ly/Exod20:2); [34:6–7](https://ref.ly/Exod34:6-Exod34:7); [Isaiah 45:3–7](https://ref.ly/Isa45:3-Isa45:7); [48:17](https://ref.ly/Isa48:17); [Mark 14:62](https://ref.ly/Mark14:62); [John 8:23–28](https://ref.ly/John8:23-John8:28)).
