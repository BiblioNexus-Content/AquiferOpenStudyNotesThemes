## Love in the Community of Christ (id: 500436)

Living in a community is not always easy. The community of Jesus Christ (the church) has often experienced disunity and division throughout its history. Even in its earliest days, the church struggled with unity issues (see [1 Corinthians 1:11–17](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:11-1Cor1:17); [Galatians 2:11–16](https://ref.ly/Gal2:11-Gal2:16)).

To solve conflicts in the Christian community, Christians must show love to one another. Jesus taught this ([Matthew 22:37–40](https://ref.ly/Matt22:37-Matt22:40); [John 13:34–35](https://ref.ly/John13:34-John13:35); see [Leviticus 19:18](https://ref.ly/Lev19:18)). The apostle Paul emphasized it ([Romans 13:8–10](https://ref.ly/Rom13:8-Rom13:10); [1 Corinthians 13:1–13](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:1-1Cor13:13)). It appears throughout the New Testament ([1 Peter 1:22](https://ref.ly/1Pet1:22); [1 John 2:7–11](https://ref.ly/1John2:7-1John2:11); [3:10](https://ref.ly/1John3:10); [4:7](https://ref.ly/1John4:7)). Loving others in the Christian community is key to Christian values ([Romans 12:9–10](https://ref.ly/Rom12:9-Rom12:10); [1 Thessalonians 4:9](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:9); [2 Peter 1:5–8](https://ref.ly/2Pet1:5-2Pet1:8)).

This kind of love is not just a feeling but a promise to help others, shown through actions. Followers of Christ should treat each other in such a way that their faith communities are famous for acts of love. The author of Hebrews gives examples of showing love in real ways within Christian communities ([Hebrews 13:1–6](https://ref.ly/Heb13:1-Heb13:6)). 

These include:

1. Being welcoming
2. Helping those persecuted or imprisoned
3. Remaining faithful in marriage
4. Not letting money control their lives

Many people misunderstand love and the character of the church. So, the church must obey the Lord's command to "continue in brotherly love" ([Hebrews 13:1](https://ref.ly/Heb13:1)).
