## God’s Sabbath Rest (id: 500431)

The idea of God's Sabbath rest (as described in [Hebrews 4:1–11](https://ref.ly/Heb4:1-Heb4:11)) has been difficult for many scholars to understand. It includes ideas from the Old Testament, like the promised land as a place to rest from slavery and wandering. It also speaks of the Sabbath day as a weekly day of rest. In [Hebrews 3:7–19](https://ref.ly/Heb3:7-Heb3:19), the author explains [Psalm 95:7–11](https://ref.ly/Ps95:7-Ps95:11). He uses the Israelite wilderness wanderers as an example of those who did not enter God's rest because they disobeyed.

What is the "rest" they failed to enter, which still remains for God's people ([Hebrews 4:1–3](https://ref.ly/Heb4:1-Heb4:3))? The author of Hebrews meant more than just the physical land of Canaan as the place of "Sabbath rest" ([4:8–9](https://ref.ly/Heb4:8-Heb4:9)). [Genesis 2:2](https://ref.ly/Gen2:2) describes God's rest as something prepared "since the foundation of the world" ([Hebrews 4:3–4](https://ref.ly/Heb4:3-Heb4:4)). God's rest involves stopping one's own work, just as God did ([4:10](https://ref.ly/Heb4:10)). Those who "hear His voice," do not harden their hearts, and believe the good news about Jesus can "enter that rest" ([4:1–3](https://ref.ly/Heb4:1-Heb4:3), [7](https://ref.ly/Heb4:7)).

The Old Testament calls the Day of Atonement “a Sabbath of complete rest” ([Leviticus 16:29–31](https://ref.ly/Lev16:29-Lev16:31)). On that day, people stopped all their work. In the new covenant, Jesus, our Great High Priest, offered a one\-time sacrifice that did "away with sin" ([9:7–28](https://ref.ly/Heb9:7-Heb9:28)). He was the final atoning sacrifice, making peace between God and people. Jesus offers people spiritual rest. They can enter this rest by trusting and obeying this good news.

God's rest through Jesus has two aspects:

1. Those who follow Jesus stop trying to earn God's acceptance through their own efforts. They trust in Jesus' completed work ([Ephesians 2:8–9](https://ref.ly/Eph2:8-Eph2:9)). They enjoy peace with God ([John 14:27](https://ref.ly/John14:27); [Acts 10:36](https://ref.ly/Acts10:36); [Romans 5:1](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1); [2 Corinthians 5:19–21](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:19-2Cor5:21)).
2. They anticipate eternal rest and joy in God's presence ([Isaiah 26:19](https://ref.ly/Isa26:19); [Revelation 14:13](https://ref.ly/Rev14:13)). Jesus Christ gives complete and perfect rest ([Matthew 11:28–30](https://ref.ly/Matt11:28-Matt11:30)).
