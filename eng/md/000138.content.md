## Material Reward (id: 500252)

In the Old Testament, people often believed that good people would always become wealthy. They saw wisdom from books like Proverbs as a universal rule. Some people still believe this today. But this teaching can cause problems.

If someone does not become rich, they might feel guilty or be judged by others. People may think they did something wrong. And if someone does become rich, they might feel proud or stop depending on God.

The suffering of Job provides as an example. His friends accepted a traditional theological view that said Job's troubles were evidence against him ([19:5](https://ref.ly/Job19:5)). They claimed his suffering was punishment for his sin ([4:7–9](https://ref.ly/Job4:7-Job4:9)). They believed Job's penalty was probably less than he deserved ([11:6](https://ref.ly/Job11:6)). Yet, God's analysis of Job's life proved this idea false ([42:7–8](https://ref.ly/Job42:7-Job42:8)). God testified to his special relationship with Job and restored Job's good reputation as his servant.

Material well\-being does not always conflict with spiritual blessings. Yet, when we see blessings as material gain, "the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth, and the desire for other things" often distract us from spiritual blessings ([Mark 4:19](https://ref.ly/Mark4:19); see also [Luke 6:25](https://ref.ly/Luke6:25)). We can easily become greedy, envious, and lustful. Our self\-worth might depend on what we own, even if we still owe money on it. This perspective is not Christian but reflects a worldly way of thinking ([1 John 2:15–17](https://ref.ly/1John2:15-1John2:17)).

In his suffering, Job went from complaining to showing humility. He recognized God's righteous power ([Job 40:4–5](https://ref.ly/Job40:4-Job40:5); [42:2–6](https://ref.ly/Job42:2-Job42:6)). We can also regard difficulties as chances for spiritual growth ([James 1:2–4](https://ref.ly/Jas1:2-Jas1:4)).
