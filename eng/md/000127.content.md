## Laziness and Hard Work (id: 500284)

God created Adam and Eve and placed them in the garden of Eden to care for it, not just to relax and enjoy it ([Genesis 2:15](https://ref.ly/Gen2:15)). Work is not a punishment from when humans first sinned. Instead, God made work to be a good and valuable part of his creation from the beginning.

The book of Proverbs often condemns laziness (being unwilling to work or make an effort when you should). Proverbs compares lazy people to a door that moves back and forth but never goes anywhere ([Proverbs 26:14](https://ref.ly/Prov26:14)). It also teaches that lazy people are foolish ([22:13](https://ref.ly/Prov22:13)). Their lack of work leads to poverty and death ([6:6–10](https://ref.ly/Prov6:6-Prov6:10); [10:26](https://ref.ly/Prov10:26); [15:19](https://ref.ly/Prov15:19); [18:9](https://ref.ly/Prov18:9); [19:15](https://ref.ly/Prov19:15), [24](https://ref.ly/Prov19:24); [20:4](https://ref.ly/Prov20:4); [21:25](https://ref.ly/Prov21:25); [22:13](https://ref.ly/Prov22:13); [24:30–34](https://ref.ly/Prov24:30-Prov24:34); [26:13–16](https://ref.ly/Prov26:13-Prov26:16)). In contrast, hardworking people are wise. Their work leads to having enough money and a good life ([10:4–6](https://ref.ly/Prov10:4-Prov10:6); [12:11](https://ref.ly/Prov12:11); [13:4](https://ref.ly/Prov13:4); [20:13](https://ref.ly/Prov20:13); [31:10–27](https://ref.ly/Prov31:10-Prov31:27)).

Ultimate meaning and fulfillment do not come from hard work ([Ecclesiastes 2:17–26](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:17-Eccl2:26)). We should not forget God's ability to provide ([Psalm 127:2](https://ref.ly/Ps127:2)). But, we have no excuse to be lazy. God designed us to use our gifts and abilities to be productive and provide for ourselves and others ([Ephesians 4:28](https://ref.ly/Eph4:28); [1 Thessalonians 4:11–12](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:11-1Thess4:12); [2 Thessalonians 3:6–13](https://ref.ly/2Thess3:6-2Thess3:13)).
