## Jews and Gentiles (Non-Jews) (id: 500397)

A key theme of the New Testament is that God has included non\-Jewish people (called gentiles) in his people while keeping his promises to Israel. In [Romans 11:11–32](https://ref.ly/Rom11:11-Rom11:32), the apostle Paul explains God's plan to save all nations in four clearly defined stages:

1. The apostles share the good news about Jesus with the Jews. Most of them do not believe it.

    Paul uses an olive tree as a metaphor. He says, “some branches have been broken off” ([Romans 11:17](https://ref.ly/Rom11:17)). This stage had already happened and Paul personally experienced it. He shared the good news with Jews in their places of worship (synagogues) across the eastern Mediterranean region. But, many Jews rejected Paul's message (see [Acts 13:42–49](https://ref.ly/Acts13:42-Acts13:49); [18:4–6](https://ref.ly/Acts18:4-Acts18:6); [28:23–28](https://ref.ly/Acts28:23-Acts28:28)).

2. Many non\-Jews accept the message and trust in Jesus.

    After God removes the "natural branches," he grafts in "a wild olive shoot” ([Romans 11:17](https://ref.ly/Rom11:17)). Paul and the other apostles encountered resistance in the synagogues. So they preached to non\-Jews, and many accepted the good news (see [Acts 13:48–49](https://ref.ly/Acts13:48-Acts13:49); [26:15–18](https://ref.ly/Acts26:15-Acts26:18)). By the time Paul wrote the letter to the Romans, the church in Rome was mostly a non\-Jewish community.

3. Many Jews accept the good news and trust in Jesus.

    As for the "natural branches," God can "graft them again" ([Romans 11:23](https://ref.ly/Rom11:23)). Paul argues that the Jews are not "beyond recovery" and can turn to Christ ([11:11](https://ref.ly/Rom11:11)). Paul hopes that as non\-Jews receive the blessings of salvation, Jews will feel inspired and respond to the good news ([11:11–15](https://ref.ly/Rom11:11)).

4. God gives great blessings to the world, including the resurrection of the dead.

    Paul suggests that when many Jews trust in Christ, it will greatly bless the world ([Romans 11:12](https://ref.ly/Rom11:12), [15](https://ref.ly/Rom11:15)). Those who accept God's offer of salvation, whether Jews or non\-Jews, experience "life from the dead" (see [11:15](https://ref.ly/Rom11:15)). They will one day experience "the resurrection of the dead" (see [1 Corinthians 15:20–26](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:20-1Cor15:26)). At the end of history, a large community of Jews and non\-Jews will praise God for his mercy. Then everyone will see and understand God's great wisdom and love ([Romans 11:33–36](https://ref.ly/Rom11:33-Rom11:36)).
