## Social Justice (id: 500327)

In the Old Testament, prophets often challenged evil in society and called for social justice (fair treatment of all people, especially the poor and vulnerable). An early example is the prophet Elijah's response to Naboth's murder and his rebuke of King Ahab ([1 Kings 21:16–24](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:16-1Kgs21:24), 800s BC). The social focus of the prophetic message grew stronger among the prophets of the 700s BC. The prophets Hosea and Amos emphasized this social focus in Israel, and the prophets Micah and Isaiah in Judah. The prophet Amos was the most vocal about social justice.

Israel's bad treatment of the powerless shocked the prophet Amos ([Amos 2:6–8](https://ref.ly/Amos2:6-Amos2:8); [3:10](https://ref.ly/Amos3:10)). Unlike nearby nations, Israel had a special relationship with God, but they abandoned him ([2:9–12](https://ref.ly/Amos2:9-Amos2:12); [3:1–2](https://ref.ly/Amos3:1-Amos3:2)). The people of Israel refused to worship God properly and oppressed the powerless, so God would judge them without mercy ([4:12](https://ref.ly/Amos4:12)). God wants his people "to let justice roll on like a river" ([Amos 5:24](https://ref.ly/Amos5:24)). Those who resist it will be swept away.

The New Testament emphasized the importance of social justice. Jesus linked true worship with practicing social justice. He warned about judgment for those who do not show their faith through loving actions (see [Matthew 25:31–46](https://ref.ly/Matt25:31-Matt25:46)). Understanding must link to action, proving one's faith (see [Luke 10:25–37](https://ref.ly/Luke10:25-Luke10:37); [John 13:35](https://ref.ly/John13:35)). The followers of Jesus understood that social justice was essential in early Christian communities (see [Acts 2:44–45](https://ref.ly/Acts2:44-Acts2:45); [Galatians 2:9–10](https://ref.ly/Gal2:9-Gal2:10); [1 Timothy 5:3–16](https://ref.ly/1Tim5:3-1Tim5:16); [James 1:27–2:26](https://ref.ly/Jas1:27-Jas2:26); [1 John 3:17–19](https://ref.ly/1John3:17-1John3:19)).

Scripture shows God's compassion for those who suffer. As followers of Jesus, we must help those in need. Like the prophets, we must stand against injustice wherever we find it.
