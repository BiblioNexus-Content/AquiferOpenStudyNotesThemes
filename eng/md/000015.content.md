## Baptism (id: 500380)

Baptism has been a key part of Christianity since it began ([Acts 2:38](https://ref.ly/Acts2:38)). In Judaism, "baptism" and "baptize" referred to a religious cleansing ceremony. The law of Moses required water to cleanse people from ceremonial impurity ([Numbers 19:14–19](https://ref.ly/Num19:14-Num19:19)). 

Later, gentile (non\-Jewish) converts to Judaism had to do certain things. These included studying the *Torah*, circumcision, and a ceremonial bath to remove spiritual impurities from their gentile past. This cleansing often took place in special baths called *mikvahs*. Many synagogues had *mikvahs*, and the temple in Jerusalem had many as well. This suggests that worshippers would ceremonially bathe before worship.

John the Baptizer preached "a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins" ([Luke 3:3](https://ref.ly/Luke3:3)). John's baptism helped spiritually prepare people to receive God's chosen one, the Messiah ([Luke 3:4–6](https://ref.ly/Luke3:4-Luke3:6)). Those who received his baptism and repented were ready for Jesus' message ([Luke 7:29–30](https://ref.ly/Luke7:29-Luke7:30)).

After his resurrection, Jesus told his disciples to baptize new Christian disciples ([Matthew 28:19](https://ref.ly/Matt28:19)). Christian baptism symbolizes dying and rising with Jesus. It represents leaving the old life and starting a new one ([Romans 6:1–4](https://ref.ly/Rom6:1-Rom6:4); [Colossians 2:12](https://ref.ly/Col2:12)). It also shows a Christian’s spiritual connection with Jesus and his Church ([Galatians 3:27](https://ref.ly/Gal3:27)). 

Baptism is the ceremony for entering the Christian community. Many see Christian baptism as the replacement for circumcision, which marked entry into Israel under the old covenant (see [Colossians 2:11–12](https://ref.ly/Col2:11-Col2:12)). Regardless of its link to Old Testament circumcision, baptism represents a changed will and "a clear conscience" that comes from God's forgiveness ([1 Peter 3:21](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:21); compare [Deuteronomy 10:16](https://ref.ly/Deut10:16); [30:6](https://ref.ly/Deut30:6); [Jeremiah 4:4](https://ref.ly/Jer4:4); [Romans 2:28–29](https://ref.ly/Rom2:28-Rom2:29); [Philippians 3:3](https://ref.ly/Phil3:3)).

Christian baptism is a ceremonial cleansing that symbolizes the forgiveness of sins ([Acts 2:38](https://ref.ly/Acts2:38); [10:43](https://ref.ly/Acts10:43); [13:38](https://ref.ly/Acts13:38); [26:17–18](https://ref.ly/Acts26:17-Acts26:18)). It also represents receiving the Holy Spirit ([2:38](https://ref.ly/Acts2:38); [9:17–18](https://ref.ly/Acts9:17-Acts9:18); [10:47–48](https://ref.ly/Acts10:47-Acts10:48); [11:15–17](https://ref.ly/Acts11:15-Acts11:17); [19:5–7](https://ref.ly/Acts19:5-Acts19:7); [Luke 3:16](https://ref.ly/Luke3:16)). Many believe baptism is an outward sign of the Spirit's inner "seal," which is a "pledge" of the eternal inheritance for God's faithful people ([2 Corinthians 1:21–22](https://ref.ly/2Cor1:21-2Cor1:22); [Ephesians 1:13–14](https://ref.ly/Eph1:13-Eph1:14); [4:30](https://ref.ly/Eph4:30); [Titus 3:5](https://ref.ly/Titus3:5)).
