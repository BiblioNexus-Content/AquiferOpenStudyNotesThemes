## Christian Joy (id: 500418)

In the final hours of his life, Jesus wanted his disciples filled with his joy (see [John 15:11](https://ref.ly/John15:11); [16:20–24](https://ref.ly/John16:20-John16:24)). Joy is a common topic in many of the apostle Paul's letters and is a key theme in Philippians. Paul often encourages Christians to be joyful, especially those facing persecution, like the Christians in Philippi and Thessalonica ([Philippians 3:1](https://ref.ly/Phil3:1); [4:4](https://ref.ly/Phil4:4); [1 Thessalonians 5:16](https://ref.ly/1Thess5:16)).

Surface\-level happiness depends on what is happening around you. Christian joy is different. It comes from a person's relationship with the Lord. It remains strong even during suffering and death. Joy comes from knowing that whatever happens, God will use everything for a Christian's ultimate good (see [Romans 5:3–4](https://ref.ly/Rom5:3-Rom5:4); [8:28](https://ref.ly/Rom8:28)). 

Christians also find joy in the active presence of God's Spirit in their hearts (see [Galatians 5:22](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22)). The real secret to a joyful life is "to be filled with the Holy Spirit" (see [Ephesians 5:18](https://ref.ly/Eph5:18)). A relationship with the living God forms Christians' attitudes, not external circumstances.
