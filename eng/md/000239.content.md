## The Message of Reconciliation (id: 500407)

*Reconciliation* is a term found throughout the New Testament. It means making peace and repairing broken relationships. When two people reconcile, they stop being enemies and become friends again. In the same way, through Jesus, people can have their relationship with God restored.

In [Romans 5:1–11](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1-Rom5:11), the apostle Paul focuses on the cost of God's reconciling work through the death of his son. 

[Colossians 1:15–20](https://ref.ly/Col1:15-Col1:20) is a hymn that praises Jesus Christ. It tells how he brings all of creation (everything in heaven and on earth) back into a right relationship with God. The passage shows that Jesus is Lord over all things that exist.

In [Ephesians 2:11–22](https://ref.ly/Eph2:11-Eph2:22), the focus is on reconciliation that includes both Jews and non\-Jews (gentiles). They form a united church with all opposition removed.

Paul explains reconciliation in detail when discussing the meaning of Jesus' death in [2 Corinthians 5:18–21](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:18-2Cor5:21). Earlier, Paul reminded the Corinthians about the importance of the cross ([1 Corinthians 15:3–5](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:3-1Cor15:5)). But he did not explain much about its meaning then. Now, he clarifies that Christ's death on the cross means Christ "became" sin so sinners could reconnect with God. 

This reconciliation changes enemies into friends. The cost of this exchange is that "God made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God" ([2 Corinthians 5:21](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:21)).

With Jesus' resurrection and his victory over death, a new world begins. In this new era, God's people have the promise of eternal union with him (see [2 Corinthians 4:14–5:10](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:14-2Cor5:10)). Those who trust in Jesus for salvation receive the Holy Spirit, which guarantees future salvation ([5:5](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:5)). They know that God accepts them and will welcome them forever.

Those who have made peace with God should help others find their way back to him ([2 Corinthians 5:18–21](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:18-2Cor5:21)). Since Christians have experienced this peace, they should also try to restore their personal relationships (see [Matthew 5:24](https://ref.ly/Matt5:24); [18:15](https://ref.ly/Matt18:15); [Romans 12:18](https://ref.ly/Rom12:18)).
