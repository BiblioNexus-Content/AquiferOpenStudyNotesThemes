## The Grace of God (id: 500389)

*Grace* is an important word in the Bible. It shows God's kindness and favor. It is often related to how he saves those who do not deserve it. The New Testament emphasizes that grace came through Jesus Christ ([John 1:14–17](https://ref.ly/John1:14-John1:17)). This does not mean God's grace was absent in the Old Testament. Instead, God's grace toward humanity achieved its goal through his Son.

According to the book of Acts, the Jewish community was the first to experience God's great favor (see [Acts 11:19–21](https://ref.ly/Acts11:19-Acts11:21); [13:43–49](https://ref.ly/Acts13:43-Acts13:49)). Later, it became obvious that God's grace through Jesus Christ also extends to non\-Jewish people (gentiles) ([Acts 15:8–9](https://ref.ly/Acts15:8-Acts15:9); [Ephesians 2:11–18](https://ref.ly/Eph2:11-Eph2:18); [Titus 2:11](https://ref.ly/Titus2:11)). Miraculous signs and wonders confirmed God's grace at work among the gentiles ([Acts 14:3](https://ref.ly/Acts14:3)).

The apostle Paul shared the good news (the gospel) about God's wonderful grace ([Acts 20:24](https://ref.ly/Acts20:24)). He did not try to prove God's grace. He assumed it as true when sharing the good news (see, for example, [Romans 3:24](https://ref.ly/Rom3:24); [5:15–21](https://ref.ly/Rom5:15-Rom5:21)). Paul made it plain that we do not earn our salvation. 

God acts only through his grace ([Romans 4:4–5](https://ref.ly/Rom4:4-Rom4:5); [Ephesians 2:4–9](https://ref.ly/Eph2:4-Eph2:9)). People cannot do good works to earn us favor with God. If they did, God would have to reward them like a worker earns a wage (see [Romans 11:5–6](https://ref.ly/Rom11:5-Rom11:6)).

God's grace affects Christians throughout their lives, not just at conversion. The letter of 2 Peter ends with a command for Christians to "grow in the grace" of "Jesus Christ" ([2 Peter 3:18](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:18)). Paul "urged them to continue in the grace of God" as they remained faithful to their Lord ([Acts 13:43](https://ref.ly/Acts13:43)). 

When Paul left the leaders of the church at Ephesus, he entrusted them "to God and to the word of His grace." This was a divine message that could strengthen and support them ([Acts 20:32](https://ref.ly/Acts20:32); see [15:40](https://ref.ly/Acts15:40)). God's grace is central to the Christian message and experience, from start to finish. It is no surprise that grace is a common theme in the writings of Jesus' early followers.
