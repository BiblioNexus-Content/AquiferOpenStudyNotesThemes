## God's Word at the Center (id: 500247)

After God told Moses the law at Mount Sinai, God wrote it in stone ([Exodus 34:1](https://ref.ly/Exod34:1)). He intended the Israelites to teach it to their children ([Deuteronomy 6:7](https://ref.ly/Deut6:7)). People attached it to their hands and foreheads, They even wrote it on the doorposts of their homes to remind them of God's words ([Deuteronomy 6:8–9](https://ref.ly/Deut6:8-Deut6:9)). 

Every seven years, the priests read God's instructions to the people to help them remember to revere God ([Deuteronomy 31:9–13](https://ref.ly/Deut31:9-Deut31:13)). Success came from studying and obeying God's word ([Joshua 1:7–8](https://ref.ly/Josh1:7-Josh1:8); [Psalms 1:2](https://ref.ly/Ps1:2); [119:15](https://ref.ly/Ps119:15)). Obedience was more important than offering sacrifices ([1 Samuel 15:22](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:22)).

When God's people ignore the Scriptures and lose sight of his truth, they often stop living how he wants. During King Josiah's time, even the priests had lost and forgotten the book of the law. When they found it in the temple, the young king read it and tore his clothing in grief. He realized the nation had abandoned the covenant ([2 Kings 22:8–13](https://ref.ly/2Kgs22:8-2Kgs22:13)).

In the fall of 445 BC, Nehemiah managed the completion of the rebuilding of Jerusalem's wall. Five days later, on the first day of the seventh month, the settlers in Judah gathered to celebrate the Feast of Trumpets. During and after the feast, the priest and scribe Ezra read from the law God gave Moses. 

As the people listened, they mourned and wept because they realized they had not obeyed God's law. They confessed their sins, studied God's word to learn what he required, and obeyed what they learned. The book of the law of Moses transformed their lives and behavior.

These events dramatically remind us that God's word is central to the lives of his people. The Scriptures are an essential guide for life and death ([Genesis 2:16–17](https://ref.ly/Gen2:16-Gen2:17)). God's promises always come true (for example, [17:15–21](https://ref.ly/Gen17:15-Gen17:21); [18:10–14](https://ref.ly/Gen18:10-Gen18:14)).

God's word is perfect. It can restore, make people wise, and bring joy ([Psalm 19:7–9](https://ref.ly/Ps19:7-Ps19:9)). Godly people love the Scriptures ([119:97](https://ref.ly/Ps119:97)). It lights their paths and helps them avoid sin ([119:105,](https://ref.ly/Ps119:105) [9](https://ref.ly/Ps119:9)). God's word achieves its purpose ([Isaiah 55:11](https://ref.ly/Isa55:11)). It remains forever ([Matthew 5:17–19](https://ref.ly/Matt5:17-Matt5:19); [24:35](https://ref.ly/Matt24:35); [2 Timothy 3:14–17](https://ref.ly/2Tim3:14-2Tim3:17)).
