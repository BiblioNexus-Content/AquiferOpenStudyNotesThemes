## Church Leaders (id: 500427)

The first church gatherings were spontaneous and God's spirit gave gifts in a special way (see [1 Corinthians 14:26–33](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:26-1Cor14:33)). The apostles generally led the Christian communities along with the elders in Jerusalem ([Acts 6:2](https://ref.ly/Acts6:2); [8:14](https://ref.ly/Acts8:14); [14:23](https://ref.ly/Acts14:23); [Acts 15:4](https://ref.ly/Acts15:4), [6](https://ref.ly/Acts15:6), [22–23](https://ref.ly/Acts15:22-Acts15:23)). Jewish synagogue and Greco\-Roman models influenced their roles. The titles and roles of Christian leaders outside Jerusalem were flexible (for example [Acts 6:1–6](https://ref.ly/Acts6:1-Acts6:6); [13:1–3](https://ref.ly/Acts13:1-Acts13:3)). But local leaders depended on the apostles when possible. 

Teachers and prophets had key roles in church meetings (see [Acts 11:27–30](https://ref.ly/Acts11:27-Acts11:30); [1 Corinthians 14:26–40](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:26-1Cor14:40)). Apostles often started churches before they appointed "elders" ([Titus 1:5](https://ref.ly/Titus1:5); [Acts 14:23](https://ref.ly/Acts14:23)). These appointments were based on spiritual gifts and sometimes on age (see [1 Corinthians 12:28–30](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:28-1Cor12:30); [Ephesians 4:11–13](https://ref.ly/Eph4:11-Eph4:13)).

Community leaders probably existed even without formal titles. In the letters to Timothy and Titus, there is a strong focus on the roles of overseer (*bishop*), elder (*presbyter*), and deacon. How these roles developed over time is unclear. The practices in 1 Timothy and Titus might not have been widespread. Elders in Ephesus and Crete may have had more teaching duties to oppose false teachers. 

Otherwise, the issues suggested in [1 Corinthians 14:26–33](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:26-1Cor14:33) might have continued. These letters focus on ensuring the gospel is shared accurately.

The apostle Paul influenced and guided the people and places where he shared the good news. But there is no evidence that Paul wanted to create a system to govern all the churches in these areas. Paul expected the overseers to continue the gospel teaching and discipline roles under the broader responsibilities and authority of the apostles. As local church leaders, they held real and unique authority in their communities (see [1 Corinthians 5:3–5](https://ref.ly/1Cor5:3-1Cor5:5); [1 Timothy 4:11–16](https://ref.ly/1Tim4:11-1Tim4:16); [5:19–22](https://ref.ly/1Tim5:19-1Tim5:22); [2 Timothy 2:14–19](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:14-2Tim2:19), [25–26](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:25-2Tim2:26); [Titus 2:15](https://ref.ly/Titus2:15); [3:10–11](https://ref.ly/Titus3:10-Titus3:11)). Soon after the apostles died, the church's structure became more centralized around the bishop's office, as shown in early second\-century Christian writings.
