## Apostasy (id: 500430)

Sadly, opposition to God is not limited to those outside the community of faith. The Bible tells of many who seemed to know God but turned away (see [Numbers 16](https://ref.ly/Num16:1-Num16:50); [Deuteronomy 13](https://ref.ly/Deut13:1-Deut13:18); [2 Kings 17:5–23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:5-2Kgs17:23); [Ezekiel 8](https://ref.ly/Ezek8:1-Ezek8:18)). God brings fair consequences to those who turn away from him ([Job 11:20](https://ref.ly/Job11:20); [Proverbs 1:24–31](https://ref.ly/Prov1:24-Prov1:31); [Jeremiah 11:11](https://ref.ly/Jer11:11)). Jesus spoke about those who "fall away" and the judgment they will receive ([Matthew 16:27](https://ref.ly/Matt16:27); [23:13](https://ref.ly/Matt23:13); [24:10–13](https://ref.ly/Matt24:10-Matt24:13); [25:41–46](https://ref.ly/Matt25:41-Matt25:46)). The New Testament writers follow his example ([Galatians 1:6–9](https://ref.ly/Gal1:6-Gal1:9); [2 Timothy 3:1–9](https://ref.ly/2Tim3:1-2Tim3:9); [2 Peter 2:1–22](https://ref.ly/2Pet2:1-2Pet2:22); [1 John 2:18–19](https://ref.ly/1John2:18-1John2:19)).

The Bible plainly states that disobeying God leads to severe consequences (see, for example, [Genesis 9:5–6](https://ref.ly/Gen9:5-Gen9:6); [Numbers 35:16–21](https://ref.ly/Num35:16-Num35:21); [Leviticus 20:10](https://ref.ly/Lev20:10); [Zechariah 5:4](https://ref.ly/Zech5:4)). God will eventually separate those who oppose his will and rule from his life\-giving presence ([Isaiah 66:14–24](https://ref.ly/Isa66:14-Isa66:24)). In a similar way, several passages in the letter to the Hebrews warn those who do not take God's word seriously. It says that they will experience spiritual trouble and encounter God's judgment (see [Hebrews 2:1–4](https://ref.ly/Heb2:1-Heb2:4); [4:12–13](https://ref.ly/Heb4:12-Heb4:13); [6:4–8](https://ref.ly/Heb6:4-Heb6:8); [10:26–31](https://ref.ly/Heb10:26-Heb10:31); [12:25–29](https://ref.ly/Heb12:25-Heb12:29)).

Scholars interpret the "warning passages" in Hebrews about *apostasy* (falling away) and judgment in different ways: 

1. Some think the warnings are suggestive. They are meant to arouse listeners from spiritual laziness, without referring to actual judgment.
2. Another view is that the author spoke of his concern about Jewish people who had not yet converted to Christianity. They were under God's judgment for not yet being part of the new covenant (God's new agreement or promise with humanity established through Jesus Christ).
3. A third perspective is that the "apostates" were Christians. Because of their spiritual state, they would encounter some of God's judgment. But, they were not at risk of losing their salvation.
4. A fourth view suggests the apostates were once full members of the Christian community. They had fully experienced the faith. But then turned away from Jesus and the church.
5. A fifth opinion is that the apostates were never true believers. This shows they never really knew Jesus from the start.

Warnings of judgment show God's grace. They intend to guide rebellious people back to God's ways. Understanding the consequences of turning away from the Christian faith can strengthen our commitment to follow Jesus faithfully.
