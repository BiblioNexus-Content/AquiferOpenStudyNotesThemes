## Atonement (id: 500181)

[Leviticus 16](https://ref.ly/Lev16:1-Lev16:34) explains the Day of Atonement. On this day, the high priest presented the community's sins to the LORD. Worshiping a holy God requires removing any ceremonial uncleanness or sin. God's grace accepted an animal's death instead of the sinner's life. In these offerings, the sacrifice represented the worshiper's life. They sacrificed the animal so the worshiper could live. Blood represents life. God chose the blood of the sacrifice "that makes atonement"([Leviticus 17:11](https://ref.ly/Lev17:11)).

Atonement involves both *expiation* and *propitiation.* *Expiation* means paying what is owed. For example, the guilt offering involves damages or property loss, which must be repaid with a 20 percent extra charge ([5:14–6:7](https://ref.ly/Lev5:14-Lev6:7)). *Propitiation* means appeasing or reconciling with an offended person or group. For example, the whole burnt offering and the sin offering do not require a plain debt payment ([1:1–17](https://ref.ly/Lev1:1-Lev1:17); [4:1–5:13](https://ref.ly/Lev4:1-Lev5:13)).

In the atoning sacrifices that make peace with God, laying hands on the animal shows the worshiper's connection to the animal ([4:4–35](https://ref.ly/Lev4:4-Lev4:35); [16:21](https://ref.ly/Lev16:21)). The blood represents the animal's life ([17:14](https://ref.ly/Lev17:14)). It replaces the worshiper's life ([17:11](https://ref.ly/Lev17:11)). They kill the animal, and offer to God its blood and certain parts in a ceremony. This cleanses and reconciles the worshiper with God.

The blood of Jesus provides atonement ([Ephesians 1:7](https://ref.ly/Eph1:7); [Colossians 1:20](https://ref.ly/Col1:20)). It secures "eternal redemption" for Christians ([Hebrews 9:12](https://ref.ly/Heb9:12)). Jesus, God's "Lamb," reconciles us with God ([John 1:29](https://ref.ly/John1:29); [Hebrews 9:14](https://ref.ly/Heb9:14)). He paid our sin debt (expiation) and satisfied God's judgment against sin (propitiation).
