## Following Jesus (id: 500353)

The Gospels (books about Jesus's life) were written to help people understand and accept Jesus' invitation to follow him by "taking up their cross." This invitation is not just for Jesus' closest followers, called apostles. It is for everyone who wants to follow him ([Mark 3:13–19](https://ref.ly/Mark3:13-Mark3:19); see also [1:16–20](https://ref.ly/Mark1:16-Mark1:20); [2:14](https://ref.ly/Mark2:14)). It is for all who wish to follow him ([Mark 8:34](https://ref.ly/Mark8:34); see also [2:15](https://ref.ly/Mark2:15); [10:21](https://ref.ly/Mark10:21), [52](https://ref.ly/Mark10:52)). Some people find it very challenging to follow Jesus, but God offers help through his grace ([Mark 10:17–25,](https://ref.ly/Mark10:17-Mark10:25) [27](https://ref.ly/Mark10:27)). Others find it easy to respond to Jesus' invitation ([Mark 2:14](https://ref.ly/Mark2:14); see also [Luke 7:36–50](https://ref.ly/Luke7:36-Luke7:50)).

To "follow Jesus" means fully committing to leave behind selfish behaviors ([Mark 8:34–35](https://ref.ly/Mark8:34-Mark8:35)). "Taking up one's cross" means being willing to give up everything for Jesus, even one's life. For example, Peter, Andrew, James, and John left their homes and jobs to follow Jesus ([Mark 1:16–20](https://ref.ly/Mark1:16-Mark1:20)). A rich man had to sell everything and give the money to the poor to stop being selfish ([Mark 10:21](https://ref.ly/Mark10:21)). 

Following Jesus also involves publicly acknowledging him and being faithful to his teachings ([Mark 8:38](https://ref.ly/Mark8:38); compare [Romans 10:9](https://ref.ly/Rom10:9)). It means removing anything that stops you from following Jesus, no matter how difficult ([Mark 9:43–48](https://ref.ly/Mark9:43-Mark9:48)). It involves trusting Jesus completely and refusing to sin ([Mark 1:15](https://ref.ly/Mark1:15); [6:12](https://ref.ly/Mark6:12)). It even requires being more loyal to Jesus than one's parents ([Matt 10:37](https://ref.ly/Matt10:37); [Luke 14:26](https://ref.ly/Luke14:26)).

Jesus clearly told his disciples to share his message ([Matthew 28:18–20](https://ref.ly/Matt28:18-Matt28:20); [Luke 24:47–49](https://ref.ly/Luke24:47-Luke24:49); [Acts 1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8)). Throughout the New Testament, we see that Jesus' followers told people about the good news wherever they went. This led many more people to become followers of Jesus (see [Acts 2:14–41](https://ref.ly/Acts2:14-Acts2:41); [3:12–26](https://ref.ly/Acts3:12-Acts3:26); [4:1–2](https://ref.ly/Acts4:1-Acts4:2), [20](https://ref.ly/Acts4:20); [8:4](https://ref.ly/Acts8:4); [9:20](https://ref.ly/Acts9:20); [11:19–26](https://ref.ly/Acts11:19-Acts11:26); [13:1–3](https://ref.ly/Acts13:1-Acts13:3); [Romans 1:1–16](https://ref.ly/Rom1:1-Rom1:16); [10:14–15](https://ref.ly/Rom10:14-Rom10:15); [15:18–21](https://ref.ly/Rom15:18-Rom15:21); [1 Corinthians 9:16](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:16); [Colossians 1:23](https://ref.ly/Col1:23); [1 Thessalonians 2:9](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:9); [2 Timothy 4:2](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:2)).

Following Jesus brings both responsibilities and rewards. Those who follow him receive:

* A place in God's kingdom ([Mark 9:43–48](https://ref.ly/Mark9:43-Mark9:48); [10:23–31](https://ref.ly/Mark10:23-Mark10:31))
* Forgiveness for their sins ([Mark 2:10–11](https://ref.ly/Mark2:10-Mark2:11); see also [3:28](https://ref.ly/Mark3:28); [11:25](https://ref.ly/Mark11:25))
* A place in God's family ([John 1:12](https://ref.ly/John1:12))
* Protection from God's judgment ([Mark 8:35](https://ref.ly/Mark8:35); [13:13](https://ref.ly/Mark13:13))
* Eternal life ([Mark 9:43](https://ref.ly/Mark9:43); [10:29–30](https://ref.ly/Mark10:29-Mark10:30); [1 John 5:11–12](https://ref.ly/1John5:11-1John5:12))
