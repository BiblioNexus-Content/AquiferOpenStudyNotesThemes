## God’s Anger (id: 500269)

God is just and righteous in his judgment ([Psalm 7:11](https://ref.ly/Ps7:11)). He responds with righteous anger toward sin and injustice. God's anger is not like human anger. It is not an emotional outburst or loss of control. It is his perfect, holy response to evil. Wicked people persist in doing wrong and deserve his judgment (see [2:5](https://ref.ly/Ps2:5), [12](https://ref.ly/Ps2:12); [21:9](https://ref.ly/Ps21:9); [56:7](https://ref.ly/Ps56:7); [59:13](https://ref.ly/Ps59:13); [69:24](https://ref.ly/Ps69:24); [79:6](https://ref.ly/Ps79:6); see also [Romans 1:18](https://ref.ly/Rom1:18)). Even though God is patient and slow to become angry, he will not allow evil to continue forever without stopping it ([86:15](https://ref.ly/Ps86:15); [103:8](https://ref.ly/Ps103:8); [145:8](https://ref.ly/Ps145:8)).

The writers of the psalms saw Israel's escape from Egypt as a lesson about God's anger. God showed his anger against the Egyptians while protecting his people ([Psalm 78:49–50](https://ref.ly/Ps78:49-Ps78:50)). But during their journey through the wilderness, Israel’s disobedience led to God's anger, and they faced his judgment ([78:31](https://ref.ly/Ps78:31); [106:29](https://ref.ly/Ps106:29), [32](https://ref.ly/Ps106:32)). 

Because of this, God promised that disobedient generation would not enter his place of rest ([Psalm 95:8–11](https://ref.ly/Ps95:8-Ps95:11)). So they died in the wilderness. But God held back his anger and did not destroy Israel completely ([78:38](https://ref.ly/Ps78:38)). 

In the same way, throughout the time of the judges and kings, God's people often disobeyed and did evil things. As a result, in his anger, God allowed foreign powers to control them and send them into exile ([2 Kings 17:5–23](https://ref.ly/2Kgs17:5-2Kgs17:23); [24:20–25:21](https://ref.ly/2Kgs24:20-2Kgs25:21)). But again, God did not allow his people to be completely destroyed.

When God's people sin and feel his anger, it can lead them to repent. This emotionally painful experience can bring great joy in God's mercy and goodness ([Psalm 30:5](https://ref.ly/Ps30:5); see also [Hebrews 12:5–11](https://ref.ly/Heb12:5-Heb12:11)).

The New Testament makes clear that all people were subject to God's wrath because of sin ([Ephesians 2:1–3](https://ref.ly/Eph2:1-Eph2:3)). But in his love, God sent his Son, Jesus Christ, who gave his life for our sins so that we could be reconciled to God ([Romans 5:6–11](https://ref.ly/Rom5:6-Rom5:11); [Ephesians 2:4–5](https://ref.ly/Eph2:4-Eph2:5)). Those who turn to God in faith will escape the punishment that is coming at the future judgment of the world. In the end, Jesus, who is both Savior and Judge, will bring God's justice against the wicked ([Psalms 2:5–9](https://ref.ly/Ps2:5-Ps2:9); [Revelation 6:15–17](https://ref.ly/Rev6:15-Rev6:17); [19:11–16](https://ref.ly/Rev19:11-Rev19:16)). God will deal decisively with all evil, including his ultimate enemy, the devil ([Revelation 20:7–15](https://ref.ly/Rev20:7-Rev20:15)).
