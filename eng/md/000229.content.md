## The Holy One of Israel (id: 500295)

The phrase *The Holy One of Israel* appears in the prophecy of Isaiah about 24 times. The Holy One is "the King" ([Isaiah 6:5](https://ref.ly/Isa6:5)). The righteous and just one is the God without equal ([26:7](https://ref.ly/Isa26:7); [40:25](https://ref.ly/Isa40:25)). He is the redeemer of his people ([41:14](https://ref.ly/Isa41:14)). 

Anyone approaching the Holy One must worship him with reverence and awe. The Holy One associates himself with Mount Zion. It is holy because it is his symbolic home (see [18:7](https://ref.ly/Isa18:7); [24:23](https://ref.ly/Isa24:23); [27:13](https://ref.ly/Isa27:13); [56:7](https://ref.ly/Isa56:7); [60:1–22](https://ref.ly/Isa60:1-Isa60:22)).

The Holy One of Israel is different from all creation because he is morally perfect creator. Sinful people cannot live with him (see [Isaiah 1:4](https://ref.ly/Isa1:4)). God's holiness requires ceremonial purity and moral perfection. God is like a consuming fire that removes anything not connected to his holy will (see [33:14](https://ref.ly/Isa33:14)).

Yet the Holy One of Israel reserves a small group of people for himself ([Isaiah 4:2–3](https://ref.ly/Isa4:2-Isa4:3); [6:13](https://ref.ly/Isa6:13)). He spiritually cleanses them and promises to be with his own redeemed people ([12:6](https://ref.ly/Isa12:6); [35:8–9](https://ref.ly/Isa35:8-Isa35:9); [62:12](https://ref.ly/Isa62:12); see also [49:7](https://ref.ly/Isa49:7)). He shows his holy power by helping sinful and weak humans. He saves them from the exile caused by their sin, and opening the new creation for them.
