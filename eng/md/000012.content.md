## Apostasy and Renewal (id: 500239)

During the time of Israel's divided kingdom, people often considered the northern kingdom of Israel as unfaithful and the southern kingdom of Judah as faithful. When Jeroboam started the northern kingdom, many righteous people moved to Judah to avoid his wickedness ([2 Chronicles 11:13–17](https://ref.ly/2Chr11:13-2Chr11:17)). Yet, the southern kingdom eventually also turned away from faith in God. 

King Ahaz became like Jeroboam: 

1. He made metal idols ([28:2](https://ref.ly/2Chr28:2)).
2. He worshiped the gods of Damascus ([28:23](https://ref.ly/2Chr28:23)).
3. He neglected the temple ([28:24](https://ref.ly/2Chr28:24); [29:7](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:7), [19](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:19)).
4. He promoted false worship ([28:24–25](https://ref.ly/2Chr28:24-2Chr28:25)).
5. His unfaithfulness was so bad that the north had more righteousness than Judah at that time (see [28:9–15](https://ref.ly/2Chr28:9-2Chr28:15)).

The person who wrote the books of Chronicles wrote to inspire hope that God would restore Judah. He showed that God always forgives those who repent. Repentance can lead to restoration and reconciliation (making peace) with God. This was seen in the northern leaders’ response to the prophet who confronted their victorious army ([28:8–15](https://ref.ly/2Chr28:8-2Chr28:15)). 

Judah's renewal under King Hezekiah also was a model for restoration and unity, similar to King Solomon’s rule. In the first year of his rule, Hezekiah began to restore the temple ([29:3](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:3)). When Hezekiah celebrated Passover, he invited people from the northern kingdom. This showed that both kingdoms could worship together at the place God had chosen ([30:18–20](https://ref.ly/2Chr30:18-2Chr30:20)). He temporarily restored the glory of Solomon’s time ([30:26](https://ref.ly/2Chr30:26); compare [7:8–10](https://ref.ly/2Chr7:8-2Chr7:10)).

Israel's exile from the promised land did not end God's covenant community. Spiritual healing was always possible if the people chose to seek the LORD. This was true whether they returned with war spoils or reunited at the Passover feast. Many Old Testament prophets who warned rebellious Judah or Israel also spoke of future renewal and restoration. 

The hope of renewal is also true for the church, even when encountering death by persecution (attacks because of their faith) or corruption (see [Revelation 2–3](https://ref.ly/Rev2:1-Rev3:22)). God's kingdom stands on the solid "rock" of his promises (see [Matthew 16:18](https://ref.ly/Matt16:18)).
