## Women’s Roles in the New Testament Church (id: 500424)

The apostle Paul's words in 1 Timothy about women's roles in the church were intended to correct what was happening in Ephesus. But Bible scholars debate how this passage applies to other situations. There are three main interpretations:

1. *Universal Interpretation.* [Galatians 3:28](https://ref.ly/Gal3:28) (“There is neither… male and female”) does not remove gender differences and roles created by God. Even if [Galatians 3:28](https://ref.ly/Gal3:28) shows the ideal of equality in God’s eternal kingdom, gender roles should follow the guidelines in [1 Timothy 2:11–15](https://ref.ly/1Tim2:11-1Tim2:15) as long as this world exists. For comparison, [Matthew 22:30](https://ref.ly/Matt22:30) talks about marriage in the new creation, which is different from the current structure described in [Genesis 2:23–24](https://ref.ly/Gen2:23-Gen2:24). It applies to our current life in a special and limited way (see [1 Timothy 4:3–5](https://ref.ly/1Tim4:3-1Tim4:5); [Matthew 19:11–12](https://ref.ly/Matt19:11-Matt19:12); [1 Corinthians 7:29–35](https://ref.ly/1Cor7:29-1Cor7:35)). The new creation's structure is not yet fully realized until the future age and is not the ideal for now.

    According to this view, Christian women everywhere must understand their role in God’s created order. They should not teach or have authority over men in the church (see also [1 Corinthians 11:2–16](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:2-1Cor11:16); [14:34–35](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:34-1Cor14:35)).

2. *Polemical Interpretation.* Paul addressed a specific issue caused by false teachings in the Ephesian church (see [1 Timothy 1:18–20](https://ref.ly/1Tim1:18-1Tim1:20); [4:1–5](https://ref.ly/1Tim4:1-1Tim4:5); compare [2 Timothy 3:6–9](https://ref.ly/2Tim3:6-2Tim3:9)). Evidence shows this teaching was disrupting family relationships (see [1 Timothy 4:3](https://ref.ly/1Tim4:3); [Titus 1:11](https://ref.ly/Titus1:11)). Some Ephesian women, influenced by local heresy, might have misused [Genesis 1–3](https://ref.ly/Gen1:1-Gen3:24) in their teachings. They could have claimed that females will dominate in the final resurrection. Some Ephesians believed the resurrection had already happened ([2 Timothy 2:18](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:18)). They emphasized Adam was to blame for the first sin.

    Paul corrected their misunderstandings by referring to the biblical text. But he did not intend to make a universal statement about women's roles in the church. His goal was to silence the false teachers in Ephesus, including the women involved. [First Timothy 2:11–15](https://ref.ly/1Tim2:11-1Tim2:15) involves a rebuke with loss of privilege specifically for those false teachers.

3. *Cultural Interpretation.* Paul’s argument was not necessarily intended for a local issue in Ephesus. It assumes a strongly patriarchal society (where men have most of the power and authority). This argument focuses on how women should behave in public (knowing their place and honoring men) and interpreting [Genesis 2:7](https://ref.ly/Gen2:7), [22](https://ref.ly/Gen2:22). According to this view, Christians should respect cultural norms as much as possible in their mission to spread the good news about Jesus ([1 Corinthians 9:19–23](https://ref.ly/1Cor9:19-1Cor9:23)).

    Also, most women in that society had limited education. Unlike many societies today, women in Paul's time usually received poor education. Because of their culture's male\-dominated structure, women would not normally have qualified as teachers and leaders.

    [First Timothy 2:11–15](https://ref.ly/1Tim2:11-1Tim2:15) reflects the idea that properly qualified people should lead and teach. Yet, there are examples in Paul’s writings and in the early church of women participating in various ministry roles (for example, [Acts 18:26](https://ref.ly/Acts18:26); [Romans 16:1–7](https://ref.ly/Rom16:1-Rom16:7); [1 Corinthians 11:5](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:5)). This raises questions about whether Paul's statements on women in the church apply to all times and places.

Christians continue to discuss these complex issues. Many Christians today hold a view called complementarianism (the belief that men and women have different but complementary roles and responsibilities in marriage, family life, and church leadership). Many others hold an egalitarian view (the belief that men and women should have equal roles and responsibilities in the church). All Christians agree that men and women are equal as beloved children of God (see [Galatians 3:26–28](https://ref.ly/Gal3:26-Gal3:28)).
