## Psalms of Suffering (id: 500261)

The four psalms of suffering (Psalms 16, 22, 40, and 69\) describe the intense distress experienced by God's servant. They are also called "Passion Psalms."

[Psalm 22](https://ref.ly/Ps22:1-Ps22:31) uses some of the most powerful language about suffering in the psalms. In this psalm, God's servant suffers even though he is righteous. There is no mention of any sin, so the psalmist's suffering seems completely unfair. Despite being treated very badly, there is no prayer for revenge (see [Psalm 137](https://ref.ly/Ps137:1-Ps137:9)). 

This psalm has important connections to Jesus’ death on the cross (for example, [Psalm 22:6–8](https://ref.ly/Ps22:6-Ps22:8), [14–18](https://ref.ly/Ps22:14-Ps22:18)). In fact, Jesus quoted part of [Psalm 22](https://ref.ly/Ps22:1-Ps22:31) while hanging on the cross ([22:1](https://ref.ly/Ps22:1); see [Matthew 27:46](https://ref.ly/Matt27:46)). The sinless Christ even prayed for those who killed him ([Luke 23:34](https://ref.ly/Luke23:34)).

Other psalms of suffering also became linked with Jesus. [Psalm 16:10](https://ref.ly/Ps16:10) anticipates Jesus’ victory over death (see [Acts 2:24–31](https://ref.ly/Acts2:24-Acts2:31)). [Psalm 40:6–8](https://ref.ly/Ps40:6-Ps40:8) suggests Jesus’ selfless, redemptive work ([Hebrews 10:5–10](https://ref.ly/Heb10:5-Heb10:10)). [Psalm 69](https://ref.ly/Ps69:1-Ps69:36) speaks of isolation because of commitment to God's cause ([69:8–9](https://ref.ly/Ps69:8-Ps69:9)). It also predicts the disciple Judas' role in God's work through Christ ([69:25–26](https://ref.ly/Ps69:25-Ps69:26); see [Psalm 109:8](https://ref.ly/Ps109:8); [Isaiah 53:10](https://ref.ly/Isa53:10); [Acts 1:20](https://ref.ly/Acts1:20)).
