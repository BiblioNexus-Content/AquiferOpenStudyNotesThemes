## The Cloud and Fire (id: 500190)

When Israel was in the wilderness, God guided them with a pillar of cloud and fire. The pillar appeared to the Israelites immediately after the first Passover, when they left Egypt ([Exodus 13:20–22](https://ref.ly/Exod13:20-Exod13:22)).

The pillar had many roles:

1. When the Egyptians chased the Israelites as the left Egypt, the pillar moved behind the Israelites and stopped the Egyptians ([Exodus 14:19–20](https://ref.ly/Exod14:19-Exod14:20)).
2. During Israel's travels, the pillar showed that "the Lord went before them" ([Exodus 13:21](https://ref.ly/Exod13:21)).
3. When the pillar settled over the tabernacle and Israel's camp, it represented the Lord's presence and protection.
4. The cloud and fire also guided the Israelites when traveling ([Exodus 40:36–38](https://ref.ly/Exod40:36-Exod40:38); [Numbers 9:17–23](https://ref.ly/Num9:17-Num9:23)). When the pillar stayed still, Israel remained in place. When it lifted and moved, the Israelites followed. They camped in different places for various lengths of time, sometimes brief and sometimes long. Thus, Israel "camped at the LORD’s command, and they set out at the LORD’s command" ([Numbers 9:23](https://ref.ly/Num9:23)).
5. The pillar of cloud and fire was like a divine flag over the tribes as they marched (compare [Numbers 10:14](https://ref.ly/Num10:14), [18](https://ref.ly/Num10:18), [22](https://ref.ly/Num10:22), [25](https://ref.ly/Num10:25)).

The pillar appeared as a cloud during the day and as a pillar of fire at night ([Numbers 9:15–16](https://ref.ly/Num9:15-Num9:16); [Exodus 13:21](https://ref.ly/Exod13:21)). In the Bible, fire and clouds often show God's presence and glory (for example, [Exodus 19:16–18](https://ref.ly/Exod19:16-Exod19:18); [24:15–18](https://ref.ly/Exod24:15-Exod24:18); [Matthew 17:5](https://ref.ly/Matt17:5); [24:30](https://ref.ly/Matt24:30); [Acts 1:9](https://ref.ly/Acts1:9); compare [Psalm 18:8–13](https://ref.ly/Ps18:8-Ps18:13)). The cloud and fire showed that God's presence and glory traveled with Israel through the wilderness. This special appearance of God (a *theophany*) stayed with them during all their travels in the wilderness ([Exodus 40:38](https://ref.ly/Exod40:38); see also [Exodus 13:22](https://ref.ly/Exod13:22)). 

Sometimes, the cloud covered the tabernacle, and the glory of the Lord filled it, so Moses could not enter ([Exodus 40:34–35](https://ref.ly/Exod40:34-Exod40:35)). Other times, the cloud came down and stayed near the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, showing that the Lord was speaking directly with Moses ([Exodus 33:7–11](https://ref.ly/Exod33:7-Exod33:11); compare [Numbers 11:25](https://ref.ly/Num11:25); [12:5](https://ref.ly/Num12:5); [Deuteronomy 31:15](https://ref.ly/Deut31:15)). The pillar of cloud and fire was a constant reminder of the Lord's presence. 

We do not have a detailed description of the fire and cloud, except that it had the shape of a pillar. Yet, it was a powerful symbol of God's special care for Israel (see [Nehemiah 9:19–21](https://ref.ly/Neh9:19-Neh9:21); compare [Psalms 46:1](https://ref.ly/Ps46:1); [139](https://ref.ly/Ps139:1-Ps139:24); [John 1:14](https://ref.ly/John1:14); [Romans 8:31–39](https://ref.ly/Rom8:31-Rom8:39)).
