## The Holy Spirit’s Work (id: 500402)

Different New Testament writers emphasized various aspects of the Holy Spirit's work. The apostle John, for example, emphasized the Spirit's role as a teacher and revealer of God's thoughts and ways ([John 14:17](https://ref.ly/John14:17), [26](https://ref.ly/John14:26); [15:26](https://ref.ly/John15:26); [16:13–15](https://ref.ly/John16:13-John16:15); [1 John 2:20](https://ref.ly/1John2:20), [27](https://ref.ly/1John2:27)). The apostle Luke focused on the Spirit's guidance and power for spreading the Christian message ([Acts 1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8); [4:8–12](https://ref.ly/Acts4:8-Acts4:12), [31](https://ref.ly/Acts4:31); [8:29–40](https://ref.ly/Acts8:29-Acts8:40); [13:9–12](https://ref.ly/Acts13:9-Acts13:12)). Meanwhile, the apostle Paul provided a broad perspective of the Spirit's work.

Paul teaches that God gives the Holy Spirit to everyone enters a saving relationship with Jesus Christ ([1 Corinthians 6:19](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:19); [Galatians 3:2–5](https://ref.ly/Gal3:2-Gal3:5); [Ephesians 1:13–14](https://ref.ly/Eph1:13-Eph1:14)). The Spirit brings new life in Christ and confirms the salvation of Christians and their identity as God's children ([1 Corinthians 6:11](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:11); [2 Thessalonians 2:13](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:13); [Romans 8:9](https://ref.ly/Rom8:9), [14–17](https://ref.ly/Rom8:14-Rom8:17)).

The Holy Spirit gives Christians:

* power over sin ([Romans 8:1–4](https://ref.ly/Rom8:1-Rom8:4));
* power to live the Christian virtues ([Galatians 5:22–23](https://ref.ly/Gal5:22-Gal5:23)); and
* power to serve in Christian ministry ([1 Corinthians 12:1–31](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:1-1Cor12:31)).

Christians must "be filled with the Holy Spirit" ([Ephesians 5:18](https://ref.ly/Eph5:18)). They may encounter a struggle between their human desires and the Spirit. But, they can please God by obeying the Spirit's guidance and strength ([Galatians 5:16–18](https://ref.ly/Gal5:16-Gal5:18)).

The Holy Spirit helps Christians understand God's thoughts and ways ([1 Corinthians 2:9–16](https://ref.ly/1Cor2:9-1Cor2:16)). He provides spiritual gifts to Christians to support the church's overall health ([12:1–31](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:1-1Cor12:31)). The Spirit guides and strengthens worship as Christians use the gifts given by him ([14:26–33](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:26-1Cor14:33), [39–40](https://ref.ly/1Cor14:39-1Cor14:40)).

The Holy Spirit guarantees that Christians will receive all the blessings God has promised ([2 Corinthians 1:21–22](https://ref.ly/2Cor1:21-2Cor1:22); [5:1–5](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:1-2Cor5:5); [Ephesians 1:13–14](https://ref.ly/Eph1:13-Eph1:14)). The Spirit supports Christians and prays for them when they are weak ([Romans 8:26–27](https://ref.ly/Rom8:26-Rom8:27)). The Spirit's goal is to make Christians "conformed to the image of" God's Son ([Romans 8:28–29](https://ref.ly/Rom8:28-Rom8:29)).
