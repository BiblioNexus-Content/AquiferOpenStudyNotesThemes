## Security and Obedience (id: 500443)

The Book of Life is a divine record that contains the names of those who belong to God and will receive eternal life ([Revelation 20:12](https://ref.ly/Rev20:12)). The idea of removing a name from the Book of Life may raise questions about whether salvation can be lost ([Revelation 3:5](https://ref.ly/Rev3:5)). Does not the New Testament tell believers that their salvation is secure?

The New Testament offers many words of comfort (for example, [John 10:27–30](https://ref.ly/John10:27-John10:30); [1 Corinthians 10:13](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:13); [Hebrews 6:18–20](https://ref.ly/Heb6:18-Heb6:20)). But it also gives strong warnings (for example, [John 15:6](https://ref.ly/John15:6); [1 Corinthians 10:6–12](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:6-1Cor10:12); [Hebrews 6:4–8](https://ref.ly/Heb6:4-Heb6:8); [Revelation 2:4–5](https://ref.ly/Rev2:4-Rev2:5); [3:11](https://ref.ly/Rev3:11)). We often dislike and avoid these warnings because they make us feel less secure. Yet, this concern for security is exactly why the New Testament writers gave these warnings. They emphasized the need for obedience, faithfulness, and endurance.

This call to obedience was not new. God repeatedly called the people of Israel to be faithful (for example, [Genesis 12:1–2](https://ref.ly/Gen12:1-Gen12:2); [15:1–18](https://ref.ly/Gen15:1-Gen15:18); [22:16–18](https://ref.ly/Gen22:16-Gen22:18); [28:13–14](https://ref.ly/Gen28:13-Gen28:14); [1 Samuel 12:19–25](https://ref.ly/1Sam12:19-1Sam12:25); [15:10–11](https://ref.ly/1Sam15:10-1Sam15:11); [28:16–19](https://ref.ly/1Sam28:16-1Sam28:19); [2 Samuel 7:11–16](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:11-2Sam7:16); [1 Kings 9:4–9](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:4-1Kgs9:9)). All of God's promises and prophecies depend on faithfulness and obedience (see especially [Jeremiah 18:7–10](https://ref.ly/Jer18:7-Jer18:10)). The apostle Paul understood that Israel's disobedience led to some being "broken off" from God's people ([Romans 11:17](https://ref.ly/Rom11:17)). He warned non\-Jewish (gentile) Christians not to be overconfident of their position ([Romans 11:13–32](https://ref.ly/Rom11:13-Rom11:32)). God's promise remains the same, but human disobedience leads to judgment. True security comes from humble obedience and reliance on God.

During New Testament times, being a Christian was difficult and dangerous. The book of Revelation offers hope for Christians, even when threatened by death. This hope comes with warnings about judgment ([Revelation 21:8](https://ref.ly/Rev21:8), [27](https://ref.ly/Rev21:27); [22:15](https://ref.ly/Rev22:15)). The call to faithfulness and obedience are major themes in Revelation (see [2:5](https://ref.ly/Rev2:5), [10–11](https://ref.ly/Rev2:10-Rev2:11), [16–17](https://ref.ly/Rev2:16-Rev2:17), [26–29](https://ref.ly/Rev2:26-Rev2:29); [3:2](https://ref.ly/Rev3:2), [12](https://ref.ly/Rev3:12), [17–19](https://ref.ly/Rev3:17-Rev3:19), [21–22](https://ref.ly/Rev3:21-Rev3:22); [7:14](https://ref.ly/Rev7:14); [13:9–10](https://ref.ly/Rev13:9-Rev13:10), [12](https://ref.ly/Rev13:12); [16:15](https://ref.ly/Rev16:15); [18:4](https://ref.ly/Rev18:4); [20:12](https://ref.ly/Rev20:12); [21:7](https://ref.ly/Rev21:7); [22:3](https://ref.ly/Rev22:3), [7](https://ref.ly/Rev22:7), [11–12](https://ref.ly/Rev22:11-Rev22:12)). The New Testament affirms that with God's help, faithful Christians will persevere to the end (see [Hebrews 13:6](https://ref.ly/Heb13:6); [James 1:25](https://ref.ly/Jas1:25); [Revelation 3:10](https://ref.ly/Rev3:10)).
