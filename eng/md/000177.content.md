## Salvation in the Psalms (id: 500260)

The writers of the psalms (called psalmists) considered God's salvation as a rescue from evil in the world. They had suffered a lot. During difficult times, they felt God had abandoned them. Meanwhile, evil people used this supposed injustice to mock godly people ([Psalm 3:2](https://ref.ly/Ps3:2); [71:10–11](https://ref.ly/Ps71:10-Ps71:11)).

The psalmists called out for help, knowing they relied entirely on the Lord ([31:15](https://ref.ly/Ps31:15); [35:17](https://ref.ly/Ps35:17); [69:13](https://ref.ly/Ps69:13)). While waiting for help, they trusted that the Lord was present, watching over them ([Psalms 46](https://ref.ly/Ps46:1-Ps46:11), [121](https://ref.ly/Ps121:1-Ps121:8)). He would not abandon them ([16:10](https://ref.ly/Ps16:10); [94:14](https://ref.ly/Ps94:14); see also [7:10](https://ref.ly/Ps7:10); [31:2](https://ref.ly/Ps31:2); [62:6–7](https://ref.ly/Ps62:6-Ps62:7); [144:2](https://ref.ly/Ps144:2)).

God graciously rescues his needy servants and answers their prayers ([20:6](https://ref.ly/Ps20:6); [28:8](https://ref.ly/Ps28:8); [34:6](https://ref.ly/Ps34:6), [18](https://ref.ly/Ps34:18); [40:1–2](https://ref.ly/Ps40:1-Ps40:2); [76:9](https://ref.ly/Ps76:9); [107](https://ref.ly/Ps107:1-Ps107:43); [145:19](https://ref.ly/Ps145:19); [149:4](https://ref.ly/Ps149:4)). When the Lord rescues his people, he gains glory when they thank, praise, and witness of him ([50:15](https://ref.ly/Ps50:15); [79:9](https://ref.ly/Ps79:9); [85:9](https://ref.ly/Ps85:9)). The Bible records God's mighty acts. This is so that his people will praise him for what he has done and trust him to rescue them.

The psalms encourage Christians to relate to these stories of salvation. For example, in [Psalm 18](https://ref.ly/Ps18:1-Ps18:50), the psalmist talks about his distress, his cries, and the Lord’s rescue ([18:17](https://ref.ly/Ps18:17), [19](https://ref.ly/Ps18:19), [20](https://ref.ly/Ps18:20), [43](https://ref.ly/Ps18:43), [48](https://ref.ly/Ps18:48)). This invites all humble people to hope in the Lord (see [72:12](https://ref.ly/Ps72:12)). The Lord has saved his people throughout history and will do so again.

Salvation does not include evil people ([69:27](https://ref.ly/Ps69:27); [119:155](https://ref.ly/Ps119:155)). Evil people mock those who trust in the Lord's rescue ([22:8](https://ref.ly/Ps22:8)). Evil people might cry for help to the Lord during judgment, but he will not save them ([18:27](https://ref.ly/Ps18:27); [50:22](https://ref.ly/Ps50:22)). Hoping for God's salvation requires living by trust and love for the Lord ([119:123](https://ref.ly/Ps119:123); [60:5](https://ref.ly/Ps60:5); [108:6](https://ref.ly/Ps108:6)). This kind of faith removes fear, knowing that the Lord acts righteously ([34:4](https://ref.ly/Ps34:4); [71:2](https://ref.ly/Ps71:2)).

The Lord Jesus came to save sinners. He helped those in need and on the edges of society. He provided physical relief to many. He died under oppression to bring spiritual freedom to the world. He saves people from themselves, from Satan, from death, and from difficulty. 

He has the power to support the faithful, judge sinners, and fully save all of God's children. He will renew everything while excluding evil people from his eternal salvation.
