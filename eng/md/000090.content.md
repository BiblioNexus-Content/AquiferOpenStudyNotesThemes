## God’s Justice (id: 500296)

God is just ([Psalm 9:7–8](https://ref.ly/Ps9:7-Ps9:8)). He hates sin and fairly rewards people and nations based on what they do ([Psalm 67:4](https://ref.ly/Ps67:4); [Isaiah 1:27](https://ref.ly/Isa1:27); [Jeremiah 46:28](https://ref.ly/Jer46:28); [Joel 3:1–8](https://ref.ly/Joel3:1-Joel3:8); [Acts 17:31](https://ref.ly/Acts17:31)). God has complete control over the natural world and all nations ([Nahum 1:4–6](https://ref.ly/Nah1:4-Nah1:6), [8](https://ref.ly/Nah1:8); [1:3](https://ref.ly/Nah1:3), [6–10](https://ref.ly/Nah1:6-Nah1:10), [15](https://ref.ly/Nah1:15)). The world and its people are powerless when opposing him ([Job 41:10–11](https://ref.ly/Job41:10-Job41:11); [Isaiah 40:22–24](https://ref.ly/Isa40:22-Isa40:24)).

The Lord's justice, known as *mishpat* in Hebrew, is part of his divine order. A world without justice ignores the creator's plan. Since the creator is just, his rule will also be just and righteous ([Deuteronomy 32:4](https://ref.ly/Deut32:4)). His Messiah (God's chosen one) will bring about a just world ([Isaiah 9:7](https://ref.ly/Isa9:7); [11:2–5](https://ref.ly/Isa11:2-Isa11:5); [16:5](https://ref.ly/Isa16:5); [32:1–2](https://ref.ly/Isa32:1-Isa32:2)). His Spirit will change the world into a place of justice, fairness, and peace ([32:15–17](https://ref.ly/Isa32:15-Isa32:17)). This is good news for the oppressed, whose rights powerful people in society have denied (see [25:4–5](https://ref.ly/Isa25:4-Isa25:5)).

God’s justice may sometimes appear slow ([Nahum 1:3](https://ref.ly/Nah1:3)). This delay is due to his patience and mercy toward people ([Jonah 3–4](https://ref.ly/Jonah3:1-Jonah4:11); [2 Peter 3:9–15](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:9-2Pet3:15)). God does not give justice without care. He provides justice with love and intends to bring those who deserve judgment into a relationship with him.

The theme of God's justice is key in the prophets, especially in the book of Isaiah. God wants his people to treat others justly ([Micah 6:8](https://ref.ly/Mic6:8); [Zechariah 7:9](https://ref.ly/Zech7:9); [Isaiah 1:17](https://ref.ly/Isa1:17); [5:7](https://ref.ly/Isa5:7); [58:6–7](https://ref.ly/Isa58:6-Isa58:7)). He often criticizes the people of Israel for acting unjustly, especially to the poor and needy (for example, [Amos 5:11–12](https://ref.ly/Amos5:11-Amos5:12); [Malachi 3:5](https://ref.ly/Mal3:5); [Isaiah 3:12–15](https://ref.ly/Isa3:12-Isa3:15); [5:7–8](https://ref.ly/Isa5:7-Isa5:8); [10:1–4](https://ref.ly/Isa10:1-Isa10:4); [29:21](https://ref.ly/Isa29:21)). Many prophets of Israel announce God's judgment on his people for their injustice. They also share prophecies against other oppressive, proud, and unjust nations. God's punishment for these actions is just (see [Isaiah 3:9–11](https://ref.ly/Isa3:9-Isa3:11); [13:11](https://ref.ly/Isa13:11); [59:18](https://ref.ly/Isa59:18)).

The book of Nahum specifically shows God's justice toward Nineveh ([1:14](https://ref.ly/Nah1:14); [2:13](https://ref.ly/Nah2:13); [3:4](https://ref.ly/Nah3:4)). Nahum's "good news" is that those who trust in God will one day enjoy peace and well\-being when evil is finally defeated ([Nahum 1:15](https://ref.ly/Nah1:15); see also [Isaiah 11:1–9](https://ref.ly/Isa11:1-Isa11:9); [Zephaniah 3:13](https://ref.ly/Zeph3:13)). This promise began its fulfillment through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ ([Acts 10:34–43](https://ref.ly/Acts10:34-Acts10:43); [Romans 10:9–15](https://ref.ly/Rom10:9-Rom10:15)). Those who trust in the Lord Jesus experience some blessings of salvation now. Yet, they wait for God's final judgment of evil and the complete arrival of his kingdom (see [Revelation 20:7–22:5](https://ref.ly/Rev20:7-Rev22:5)).

All humanity is condemned because of sin before the just and holy God. Yet, God offers grace that we do not deserve. Through Jesus Christ, God placed his judgment against sin on a willing substitute. Jesus' death is a substitute for humanity's death. Jesus' death encourages people to turn away from sin and live by God's righteousness ([Romans 6:22–23](https://ref.ly/Rom6:22-Rom6:23); [1 Peter 3:18](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:18)). When God finally establishes his kingdom through Jesus, the world will also be just and righteous ([Isaiah 1:26](https://ref.ly/Isa1:26); [28:6](https://ref.ly/Isa28:6); [2 Peter 3:13](https://ref.ly/2Pet3:13)).
