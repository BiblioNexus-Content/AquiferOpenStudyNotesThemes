## God’s Word (id: 500432)

A basic truth of Scripture is that God has spoken. The author of the letter to the Hebrews, like other Jewish preachers of the time, presents the Old Testament as words from God. He often starts passages with "God says…" or similar phrases. God may speak a promise or a warning ([Hebrews 6:13–14](https://ref.ly/Heb6:13-Heb6:14); [3:11](https://ref.ly/Heb3:11); [4:11–12](https://ref.ly/Heb4:11-Heb4:12)). He may tell us about himself or his son or reveal his will (see [1:5–12](https://ref.ly/Heb1:5-Heb1:12); see [8:7–13](https://ref.ly/Heb8:7-Heb8:13); [10:5–7](https://ref.ly/Heb10:5-Heb10:7)). God's word created the universe and still controls it ([Genesis 1:3–28](https://ref.ly/Gen1:3-Gen1:28); [Hebrews 1:3](https://ref.ly/Heb1:3); [11:3](https://ref.ly/Heb11:3)).

In the past, God's word came mainly through angels or prophets. Now, it comes mainly through Jesus, God's son ([Hebrews 1:1–4](https://ref.ly/Heb1:1-Heb1:4); [2:3–4](https://ref.ly/Heb2:3-Heb2:4); compare [John 1:1–14](https://ref.ly/John1:1-John1:14)). People must hear, listen to, obey, and believe this word as a source of hope.

Through his word, God starts a relationship with us. He wants us to listen and respond with faith (see [Genesis 15:6](https://ref.ly/Gen15:6); [John 1:12](https://ref.ly/John1:12)). His word is powerful and purposeful, offering deep hope because God keeps his promises ([Hebrews 6:13–20](https://ref.ly/Heb6:13-Heb6:20)).
