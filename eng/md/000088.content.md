## God’s Instructions (id: 500177)

The common Hebrew word *torah* is usually translated "law" in most English versions. This translation comes from the Greek word *nomos*, which often means "law." The Septuagint (the ancient Greek Old Testament) used *nomos* to translate *torah*. Yet, *torah* basically means "teaching," "instruction," or "doctrine."

The term *law* often makes people think of rules enforced by an outside authority, like a government. It is often considered to be strict and rigid. Yet, the *torah* of Moses gives instructions including: 

* Rules
* Stories ([Leviticus 10:1–3](https://ref.ly/Lev10:1-Lev10:3))
* Poetry ([Deuteronomy 32:1–43](https://ref.ly/Deut32:1-Deut32:43))
* Lists of family lines ([Exodus 6:14–25](https://ref.ly/Exod6:14-Exod6:25))
* Other literary forms

Other words translate as "law" and are part of the instructions given to the Israelites. For example, *khoq*, meaning "statute," refers to a law given by a lawgiver (for example, [Leviticus 6:22](https://ref.ly/Lev6:22)). It states a general principle, allowing context or courts to interpret how to apply it. 

In [Leviticus 18:4–5](https://ref.ly/Lev18:4-Lev18:5) and [19:37](https://ref.ly/Lev19:37), the Hebrew word *khuqqah* (meaning "decrees") is paired with *mishpatim* (meaning "regulations"). These are case laws. It is impossible to write laws for every situation. A case law refers to a court's previous interpretation of a statute in certain cases. The court's past decisions guide similar cases in the present time.

Law is necessary because there will always be people who need it to restrain them from sinning. "Law" can describe much of the Old Testament Torah*.* More generally, the Torah teaches God's people about him and what their relationship is to him. In a similar way, teaching doctrine and how to live godly are key parts of the Christian church and its life\-giving message to the world ([Colossians 3:16](https://ref.ly/Col3:16)).
