## The Poor and Needy in the Psalms (id: 500259)

Throughout the Bible, God supports those who are poor and needy. These people are often oppressed and treated badly by society or greedy people. The book of Psalms frequently mentions the struggles of the oppressed and God's concern for them. In their distress, the poor and needy can find refuge in the Lord (see [Psalms 76:9](https://ref.ly/Ps76:9); [107:4–9](https://ref.ly/Ps107:4-Ps107:9)). They can call out to him, as he has promised to care for them (see [25:16–18](https://ref.ly/Ps25:16-Ps25:18); [70:1–5](https://ref.ly/Ps70:1-Ps70:5); [74:19](https://ref.ly/Ps74:19)). They can trust him and wait with hope for him to bring justice ([18:1–50](https://ref.ly/Ps18:1-Ps18:50); [70:5](https://ref.ly/Ps70:5)).

Many people may experience life with sorrow ([Psalms 88:13–15](https://ref.ly/Ps88:15); [90:15](https://ref.ly/Ps90:15); see [102:1–28](https://ref.ly/Ps102:1-Ps102:28)). Distress can be a form of discipline that teaches righteousness ([119:71](https://ref.ly/Ps119:71), [75](https://ref.ly/Ps119:75)). No matter how long, severe, or what causes it, the Lord hears the cries of the poor, as many psalms show ([10:17–18](https://ref.ly/Ps10:17-Ps10:18); [12:5](https://ref.ly/Ps12:5); [22:24](https://ref.ly/Ps22:24); [35:10](https://ref.ly/Ps35:10); [109:31](https://ref.ly/Ps109:31); [113:5–7](https://ref.ly/Ps113:5-Ps113:7); [140:12](https://ref.ly/Ps140:12)). In the end, God will satisfy the poor and the godly will rejoice (see [22:26](https://ref.ly/Ps22:26); [132:15](https://ref.ly/Ps132:15); [34:1–2](https://ref.ly/Ps34:1-Ps34:2); [69:32](https://ref.ly/Ps69:32)).

God chose the kings from David's family line to bring justice to God's suffering people ([Psalm 72:2](https://ref.ly/Ps72:2), [4](https://ref.ly/Ps72:4), [12](https://ref.ly/Ps72:12)). But they did not succeed. Jesus, the Christ king, understands our human struggles ([Isaiah 53:4](https://ref.ly/Isa53:4), [7](https://ref.ly/Isa53:7)). He has come to help the poor and oppressed ([Luke 4:17–21](https://ref.ly/Luke4:17-Luke4:21); see [Isaiah 61:1–3](https://ref.ly/Isa61:1-Isa61:3)). He is the hope for those who know they need him and who desire righteousness ([Matthew 5:3–12](https://ref.ly/Matt5:3-Matt5:12)).
