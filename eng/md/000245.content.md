## The New Order (id: 500300)

Isaiah describes two different ways the world can be. The first way (the *old order*) is how things are now, where people struggle with power and difficulties. The second way (the *new order*) is God's new creation that will come in the future, where everything will be fair and people will live together in peace.

When Isaiah thinks about the old way of life, he remembers:

* sadness ([Isaiah 65:19](https://ref.ly/Isa65:19)).
* death ([65:20](https://ref.ly/Isa65:20))
* injustice and violence ([65:21–22](https://ref.ly/Isa65:21-Isa65:22))
* the absence of God ([65:24](https://ref.ly/Isa65:24))

In this old way of life, people trust in their own strength and are proud.

Isaiah's vision of the new order focuses on the Lord as the great king in holiness and glory (see [6:1–5](https://ref.ly/Isa6:1-Isa6:5)). 

God's people experience aspects of this new order now, such as: 

* God's comfort ([40:1](https://ref.ly/Isa40:1))
* salvation ([45:22](https://ref.ly/Isa45:22))
* joy ([24:14–15](https://ref.ly/Isa24:14-Isa24:15))
* righteousness ([24:16](https://ref.ly/Isa24:16))
* peace ([26:3](https://ref.ly/Isa26:3))
* divine blessing and protection

There are other aspects that we cannot experience yet, such as: 

* the end of death ([25:7–8](https://ref.ly/Isa25:7-Isa25:8))
* resurrection ([26:19](https://ref.ly/Isa26:19))
* the end of fighting, wrongdoing, and evil ([60:18](https://ref.ly/Isa60:18); [65:25](https://ref.ly/Isa65:25))
* full enjoyment of God's presence ([60:19](https://ref.ly/Isa60:19)).
* God ruling in his eternal kingdom without opposition (see [Revelation 21–22](https://ref.ly/Rev21:1-Rev22:21))

Those who trust in God anticipate these things in the future.
