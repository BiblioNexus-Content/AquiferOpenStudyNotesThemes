## Persecution (id: 500382)

Persecution refers to systematic mistreatment, harassment, or oppression of an individual or group because of their identity, beliefs, or practices. In religious contexts specifically, persecution involves the targeting of people for their religious faith or practices.

Persecution is a common experience for God's people. God's servants have often faced hostility and opposition (for example, [Deuteronomy 30:7](https://ref.ly/Deut30:7); [1 Kings 18:13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs18:13); [Nehemiah 4:1–3](https://ref.ly/Neh4:1-Neh4:3); [Jeremiah 37:11–38:28](https://ref.ly/Jer37:11-Jer38:28); [Matthew 23:34–37](https://ref.ly/Matt23:34-Matt23:37); [Luke 11:49–51](https://ref.ly/Luke11:49-Luke11:51); [1 Thessalonians 2:14–16](https://ref.ly/1Thess2:14-1Thess2:16)). Jesus himself faced persecution ([Luke 4:28–30](https://ref.ly/Luke4:28-Luke4:30); [John 5:16](https://ref.ly/John5:16)). 

At the end of his earthly life, he suffered mocking, beating, and a terrible death by crucifixion. He told his disciples to expect similar treatment ([Matthew 10:16–25](https://ref.ly/Matt10:16-Matt10:25); [24:9](https://ref.ly/Matt24:9); [Mark 13:9–13](https://ref.ly/Mark13:9-Mark13:13); [Luke 21:12–17](https://ref.ly/Luke21:12-Luke21:17); [John 16:2](https://ref.ly/John16:2)). He prepared his followers for these times, telling them that the Holy Spirit would give them the courage they needed ([Luke 12:11–12](https://ref.ly/Luke12:11-Luke12:12); [21:14–15](https://ref.ly/Luke21:14-Luke21:15); [Acts 1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8)).

The book of Acts describes how the earliest Christians faced persecution. It started with the Jewish high council's (Sanhedrin) hostility. Saul of Tarsus persecuted the early church before he met Jesus in a vision near Damascus ([Acts 8:1–3](https://ref.ly/Acts8:3); [9:1–13](https://ref.ly/Acts9:1-Acts9:13), [21](https://ref.ly/Acts9:21); [22:4](https://ref.ly/Acts22:4); [26:9–11](https://ref.ly/Acts26:9-Acts26:11); see [1 Corinthians 15:9](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:9); [Galatians 1:13](https://ref.ly/Gal1:13); [Philippians 3:6](https://ref.ly/Phil3:6)). The apostles Peter, John, Stephen, James, Paul, and Barnabas all suffered persecution ([Acts 4:15–18](https://ref.ly/Acts4:15-Acts4:18); [5:17–18](https://ref.ly/Acts5:17-Acts5:18); [7:54–60](https://ref.ly/Acts7:54-Acts7:60); [12:1–4](https://ref.ly/Acts12:1-Acts12:4); [14:5–6](https://ref.ly/Acts14:5-Acts14:6)). 

In his parable of the farmer and the seed, Jesus explained how persecution affects those with weak faith ([Matthew 13:20–21](https://ref.ly/Matt13:20-Matt13:21); [Mark 4:16–17](https://ref.ly/Mark4:16-Mark4:17)). Persecution purifies God's people and helps them become more like Jesus. The apostles' experiences in the book of Acts support Paul's statement: “Indeed, all who desire to live godly lives in Christ Jesus will be persecuted” ([2 Timothy 3:12](https://ref.ly/2Tim3:12); see [Mark 10:29–30](https://ref.ly/Mark10:29-Mark10:30)).

Jesus told his disciples to be ready to defend their faith in difficult situations ([Matthew 10:18–20](https://ref.ly/Matt10:18-Matt10:20); [Luke 21:12–15](https://ref.ly/Luke21:12-Luke21:15)). The apostles and other leaders did this with courage and boldness (for example, [Acts 4:8–12](https://ref.ly/Acts4:8-Acts4:12), [31](https://ref.ly/Acts4:31); [5:29–32](https://ref.ly/Acts5:29-Acts5:32); [6:8–10](https://ref.ly/Acts6:8-Acts6:10); [8:4–40](https://ref.ly/Acts8:4-Acts8:40); [9:27](https://ref.ly/Acts9:27)). The Scriptures encourage Christians to defend their faith bravely and kindly. They must be able to explain their beliefs to those who ask questions ([Colossians 4:6](https://ref.ly/Col4:6); [2 Timothy 2:24–25](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:24-2Tim2:25); [1 Peter 3:15](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:15)).
