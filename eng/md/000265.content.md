## The Shepherd (id: 500262)

In ancient Jewish society, shepherds who cared for sheep or goats were important. Shepherding was essential in the ancient Near East. Each morning, the shepherd led the flock out ([John 10:2–4](https://ref.ly/John10:2-John10:4)). He found grass and water and protected them from wild animals ([Amos 3:12](https://ref.ly/Amos3:12)). He searched for and returned any of the flock that wandered off ([Ezekiel 34:8](https://ref.ly/Ezek34:8); [Matthew 18:12](https://ref.ly/Matt18:12)). He returned the flock to the pen every evening.

The word *shepherd* became a common term for a ruler. People often referred to the kings of Assyria, Babylon, and Egypt as shepherds because they protected their people. This metaphor is also common in the Old Testament ([Numbers 27:17](https://ref.ly/Num27:17); [1 Kings 22:17](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:17); [Jeremiah 10:21](https://ref.ly/Jer10:21); [23:1–2](https://ref.ly/Jer23:1-Jer23:2); [Ezekiel 34:1–10](https://ref.ly/Ezek34:1-Ezek34:10)).

The Old Testament regards God as the "Shepherd of Israel," caring for every part of his people's well\-being ([Genesis 49:24](https://ref.ly/Gen49:24); [Psalms 23:1](https://ref.ly/Ps23:1); [80:1](https://ref.ly/Ps80:1); [Isaiah 40:11](https://ref.ly/Isa40:11)). God himself would take care of his flock ([Jeremiah 23:3](https://ref.ly/Jer23:3); [31:10](https://ref.ly/Jer31:10); [Ezekiel 34:11–22](https://ref.ly/Ezek34:11-Ezek34:22)). He promised to provide faithful leaders who cared for his people ([Jeremiah 3:15](https://ref.ly/Jer3:15); [23:4](https://ref.ly/Jer23:4)). 

When Israel's early leaders were unfaithful, God took action and chose his servant David as a faithful leader. He later promised to establish David's descendants as leaders over Israel (see [Ezekiel 34:23–24](https://ref.ly/Ezek34:23-Ezek34:24)). By the time of the prophet Jeremiah, *shepherd* began to refer to the coming Messiah (God's chosen one).

In the New Testament, Jesus called himself "the Shepherd" ([Matthew 25:31–33](https://ref.ly/Matt25:31-Matt25:33); [Mark 14:27](https://ref.ly/Mark14:27); [John 10:1–30](https://ref.ly/John10:1-John10:30)). He is the "Good Shepherd" who sacrifices his life for the sheep ([John 10:11–18](https://ref.ly/John10:11-John10:18); see also [Hebrews 13:20](https://ref.ly/Heb13:20)).

The church leaders are also known as shepherds ([Ephesians 4:11](https://ref.ly/Eph4:11), translated as “pastors”). God gives them to the church to care for his people like a shepherd cares for sheep, guiding and teaching them in God's ways. They must remain faithful shepherds until Jesus Christ, "the Chief Shepherd," comes to lead his people directly ([1 Peter 5:1–4](https://ref.ly/1Pet5:1-1Pet5:4)).
