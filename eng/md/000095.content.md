## God’s Presence in the Psalms (id: 500263)

The writers of Scripture often express the desire to experience God's presence. In this close experience, God's goodness and love are all people need (see [Psalm 21:6](https://ref.ly/Ps21:6)). In a similar way, when God is absent, it causes distress and harm.

The poets of Israel often spoke as if God has a "face" to show his presence or absence. They sought his "face" ([Psalms 4:6](https://ref.ly/Ps24:6); [105:4](https://ref.ly/Ps105:4)). When God caused "His face to shine" or turned toward his people, they felt his presence. This came through blessings, provision, and protection ([67:1](https://ref.ly/Ps67:1); [80:3–19](https://ref.ly/Ps80:3-Ps80:19)). 

When God hid his "face," it represented divine abandonment ([Psalms 13:1](https://ref.ly/Ps13:1); [27:9](https://ref.ly/Ps27:9); [44:24](https://ref.ly/Ps44:24); [69:17](https://ref.ly/Ps69:17); [88:14](https://ref.ly/Ps88:14); [89:46](https://ref.ly/Ps89:46); [102:2](https://ref.ly/Ps102:2); [104:29](https://ref.ly/Ps104:29); [143:7](https://ref.ly/Ps143:7)). It was as if God did not see or hear them ([10:11](https://ref.ly/Ps10:11); [42:3](https://ref.ly/Ps42:3)). God's absence causes fear, shame, and chaos, and could even lead to death ([30:7](https://ref.ly/Ps30:7); [44:24](https://ref.ly/Ps44:24); [104:29](https://ref.ly/Ps104:29)).

The psalmists (the people who wrote the psalms) prayed for God's presence when they wanted a change in situation ([Psalms 31:15–16](https://ref.ly/Ps31:15-Ps31:16); [67:1](https://ref.ly/Ps67:1); [69:17](https://ref.ly/Ps69:17); [80:3](https://ref.ly/Ps80:3), [7](https://ref.ly/Ps80:7), [19](https://ref.ly/Ps80:19)). They recognized that his presence helped them ([44:3](https://ref.ly/Ps44:3)). Faithful people desire to be in God's presence ([11:7](https://ref.ly/Ps11:7); [16:9–11](https://ref.ly/Ps16:9-Ps16:11); [17:15](https://ref.ly/Ps17:15)). His presence alone fulfills their deepest desires ([17:15](https://ref.ly/Ps17:15)). It brings them lasting joy ([37:4](https://ref.ly/Ps37:4); [43:4](https://ref.ly/Ps43:4); [73:25](https://ref.ly/Ps73:25)). Everything about God brings them joy.

People experience God's favor and goodness through his presence ([Psalm 23:6](https://ref.ly/Ps23:6)). Blessings, abundant crops, and prosperity indicate his presence ([21:3](https://ref.ly/Ps21:3); [65:11](https://ref.ly/Ps65:11); [68:10](https://ref.ly/Ps68:10); [85:12](https://ref.ly/Ps85:12); [106:5](https://ref.ly/Ps106:5); [128:2](https://ref.ly/Ps128:2)). God's goodness closely connects to the temple, where his presence is especially obvious ([65:4](https://ref.ly/Ps65:4)). His presence brings health and life to his people and provides their needs ([107:9](https://ref.ly/Ps107:9)). For the psalmists, God's presence was necessary for living well and thriving.
