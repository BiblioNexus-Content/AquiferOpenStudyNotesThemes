## Infertility (id: 500162)

Almost all of the wives of the patriarchs suffered infertility (they were unable to have children) before eventually having children. The only possible exception was Leah, and even she could not have children for some time ([Genesis 11:30](https://ref.ly/Gen11:30); [25:21](https://ref.ly/Gen25:21); [29:31](https://ref.ly/Gen29:31); see also [1 Samuel 1:1–18](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:1-1Sam1:18)). Children continued the family line, protected the tribe, and provided labor. They guaranteed that property stayed within the family, they had help in old age, and performed proper funeral ceremonies. 

Therefore, infertility was a serious disgrace for a woman in that culture ([Psalm 113:9](https://ref.ly/Ps113:9); [Proverbs 30:15–16](https://ref.ly/Prov30:15-Prov30:16); [Isaiah 54:1](https://ref.ly/Isa54:1)). She understood herself to be created as a vessel of life ([Genesis 1:28](https://ref.ly/Gen1:28); [3:20](https://ref.ly/Gen3:20)). So, people considered it as a denial of blessing, purpose, and desire ([1:28](https://ref.ly/Gen1:28)). Infertility brought shame, ridicule, and intense jealousy ([1 Samuel 1:7](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:7) [Genesis 16:4](https://ref.ly/Gen16:4); [30:1](https://ref.ly/Gen30:1)).

In the Old Testament, childlessness is an issue related to God. The creator controls fertility ([Genesis 20:17–18](https://ref.ly/Gen20:17-Gen20:18); [30:2](https://ref.ly/Gen30:2), [22–23](https://ref.ly/Gen30:22-Gen30:23); [1 Samuel 1:6](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:6), [27](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:27)). He decides who can have children based on his plans and promises ([Genesis 17:19](https://ref.ly/Gen17:19); [30:2](https://ref.ly/Gen30:2); [Psalm 113:9](https://ref.ly/Ps113:9); [Luke 1:11–20](https://ref.ly/Luke1:11-Luke1:20); [Romans 4:19](https://ref.ly/Rom4:19)). God often used infertility before the birth of a promised or special child, to show it was his work. 

Not being able to have children tests patience and encourages prayer and faith ([Genesis 25:21](https://ref.ly/Gen25:21); [1 Samuel 1:11](https://ref.ly/1Sam1:11)). Abraham learned to trust God's promise long before his child was born ([Genesis 15:4–6](https://ref.ly/Gen15:4-Gen15:6); [17:15–21](https://ref.ly/Gen17:15-Gen17:21); [Romans 4:20–22](https://ref.ly/Rom4:20-Rom4:22)). When an infertile couple has a child, it shows God's faithfulness and creative power.

God's delays do not always mean denial. They remind people to use challenges for growth and to appreciate children as gifts. A childless home can focus on devotion to God, accepting his will. Some couples may remain unable to have children for their entire lives. God's people should not isolate those experiencing infertility. Instead, they should offer love and support.
