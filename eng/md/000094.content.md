## God’s Plan to Restore (id: 500234)

One of the best\-known verses in the book of 2 Chronicles explains God's plan for Israel: “And if My people who are called by My name humble themselves and pray and seek My face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, forgive their sin, and heal their land” ([2 Chronicles 7:14](https://ref.ly/2Chr7:14)). This verse shows the how the writer of the Chronicles views the way God works with his people. Some call this idea a “theology of immediate retribution.” This means that each person experiences the results of their actions during their lifetime.

The words humble, pray, turn, seek, and heal often appear in the Chronicles. The writer of Chronicles shows how these actions affected the kings of Judah. One clear example is the celebration of Passover during King Hezekiah's rule. In the first month of his rule, Hezekiah began restoring the temple ([2 Chronicles 29:3](https://ref.ly/2Chr29:3)). He invited all of Israel, including the northern kingdom, to the Passover feast in Jerusalem ([30:1](https://ref.ly/2Chr30:1)). 

Hezekiah's messengers urged the people to "return to the LORD" ([2 Chronicles 30:6](https://ref.ly/2Chr30:6)). Many from the north humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem ([30:11](https://ref.ly/2Chr30:11)). So many people came that the Judeans could not accommodate them. Those from the north did not ceremonially prepare themselves to observe the Passover. 

Hezekiah prayed for the people as they decided to seek the Lord ([2 Chronicles 30:18–19](https://ref.ly/2Chr30:18-2Chr30:19)). The Lord healed the people, allowing everyone to participate ([30:20](https://ref.ly/2Chr30:20)). The festival was so successful that they extended it for another seven days ([30:23](https://ref.ly/2Chr30:23)). Hezekiah followed the principles Solomon had stated in his prayer. King Manasseh is another example of God's redemption at work ([33:11–23](https://ref.ly/2Chr33:11-2Chr33:23)).

Israelites who knew the themes of Chronicles would understand the message of John the Baptist. He called for repentance and healing ([Matthew 3:5–12](https://ref.ly/Matt3:5-Matt3:12)). If you do not repent, you will experience judgment. Yet, God will redeem those willing to humble themselves before him.
