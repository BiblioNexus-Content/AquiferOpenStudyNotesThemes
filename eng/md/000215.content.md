## The Creator-King (id: 500271)

God created and established the world. All of creation is his work ([Genesis 1–2](https://ref.ly/Gen1:1-Gen2:25); [Psalm 24:1–2](https://ref.ly/Ps24:1-Ps24:2); [95:4–5](https://ref.ly/Ps95:4-Ps95:5)). He also rules over his creation, managing and caring for everything he has made ([95:6–7](https://ref.ly/Ps95:6-Ps95:7); [96:10](https://ref.ly/Ps96:10)).

Several psalms celebrate God's glory in creation ([Psalms 8](https://ref.ly/Ps8:1-Ps8:9); [19](https://ref.ly/Ps19:1-Ps19:14); [28](https://ref.ly/Ps28:1-Ps28:9); [33](https://ref.ly/Ps33:1-Ps33:22); [89](https://ref.ly/Ps89:1-Ps89:52); [and 104](https://ref.ly/Ps104:1-Ps104:35)): 

1. [Psalm 8](https://ref.ly/Ps8:1-Ps8:9) emphasizes how God gives humans splendor and makes them rulers of creation.
2. [Psalm 19](https://ref.ly/Ps19:1-Ps19:14) encourages us to think deeply about creation to gain wisdom.

6. [Psalms 93–100](https://ref.ly/Ps93:1-Ps100:5) reflect on God's rule over the world. The earth belongs to him, and he has shown his power throughout history.
7. [Psalm 104](https://ref.ly/Ps104:1-Ps104:35) is a hymn about creation. It turns the six days of creation into a beautiful song praising God's wisdom.

Scripture commands all nations to acknowledge and praise God, accepting his supreme authority (see [Psalm 9:11](https://ref.ly/Ps9:11); [47:1–2](https://ref.ly/Ps47:1-Ps47:2), [7–9](https://ref.ly/Ps47:7-Ps47:9); [66:8](https://ref.ly/Ps66:8); [117:1](https://ref.ly/Ps117:1)).
