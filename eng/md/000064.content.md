## Fear of the Lord (id: 500276)

As Moses gives his final instructions to the people of Israel before his death, he repeatedly urges them to "fear the LORD" (see, for example, [Deuteronomy 6:1–13](https://ref.ly/Deut6:1-Deut6:13); [10:12–21](https://ref.ly/Deut10:12-Deut10:21); [31:9–13](https://ref.ly/Deut31:9-Deut31:13)). Joshua gives the same advice near the end of his life ([Joshua 24:14](https://ref.ly/Josh24:14)). *Fear* means respect, a feeling of wonder at something great, and sometimes being very afraid. Fearing the Lord involves always being aware of his authority and power. For the Israelites, fearing the Lord meant recognizing that their success depended entirely on God.

The main theme of Proverbs is summarized in the words: “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge” ([Proverbs 1:7](https://ref.ly/Prov1:7)). This fear makes people humble and less prideful ([3:7](https://ref.ly/Prov3:7); [15:33](https://ref.ly/Prov15:33)). With this attitude, people will obey God more than rely on their own judgment. Fear of the Lord acknowledges God's central role in the world's order. God is the creator and master of everything. 

This is why [Psalm 14:1](https://ref.ly/Ps14:1) calls those who reject God “fools.” Those who fear the Lord gain wisdom because they understand that everything is under God's rule and serves him. This is more than just an attitude. It is a way of living that respects God's power and authority and our ultimate responsibility to him.

Wisdom is linked to a good relationship with God. Both need choices that match God's character (see [Job 28:28](https://ref.ly/Job28:28); [Proverbs 14:2](https://ref.ly/Prov14:2); [Ecclesiastes 12:13](https://ref.ly/Eccl12:13)). Do you want wisdom? Then you must be in a relationship with the one who has all wisdom (see [1 Corinthians 1:1–2:16](https://ref.ly/1Cor1:1-1Cor2:16); [Colossians 2:3](https://ref.ly/Col2:3)).
