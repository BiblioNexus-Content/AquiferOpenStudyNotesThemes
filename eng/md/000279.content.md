## The World (id: 500375)

The book of John often uses the word "world" (Greek *kosmos*). In Greek\-speaking Jewish thought, *kosmos* means the heavens and the earth created by God ([Genesis 1](https://ref.ly/Gen1:1-Gen1:31); see also [John 1:3](https://ref.ly/John1:3), [10](https://ref.ly/John1:10); [17:5](https://ref.ly/John17:5), [24](https://ref.ly/John17:24)). The apostle John expands this idea to include humanity (for example, [1:10](https://ref.ly/John1:10); [3:16](https://ref.ly/John3:16)).

Although God created it as good, the human world now opposes God ([John 1:10–11](https://ref.ly/John1:10-John1:11); [3:19–20](https://ref.ly/John3:19-John3:20); [12:37–41](https://ref.ly/John12:37-John12:41)). People love the darkness and cannot understand the light, actively resisting it ([3:19](https://ref.ly/John3:19)). The world is without life and needs life ([6:33](https://ref.ly/John6:33), [51](https://ref.ly/John6:51)). Yet, it hates the one who can save it ([7:7](https://ref.ly/John7:7)). Satan is the "prince of this world" ([12:31](https://ref.ly/John12:31)). But he will encounter judgment one day.

God loves humanity, even though people often oppose and rebel against him. Jesus died to remove the world's sin ([John 1:29](https://ref.ly/John1:29); [3:16–17](https://ref.ly/John3:16-John3:17); [1 John 2:2](https://ref.ly/1John2:2)). Yet, God's love for his creation exists alongside his need to judge the sin in the world ([John 3:18–21](https://ref.ly/John3:18-John3:21), [36](https://ref.ly/John3:36); [5:27–30](https://ref.ly/John5:27-John5:30); [12:47–48](https://ref.ly/John12:47-John12:48)). Followers of Jesus feel this same tension in their mission. God calls us to share his love with the world. But we will encounter conflict because the world may oppose our message (see [15:18–27](https://ref.ly/John15:18-John15:27); [17:13–26](https://ref.ly/John17:13-John17:26)).
