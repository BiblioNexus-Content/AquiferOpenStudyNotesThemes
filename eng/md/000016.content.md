## Basic Laws (id: 500302)

In Scripture, the one true God is the highest authority. God's laws include both positive and negative commands. Two main laws summarize the positive commands: 

* “You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength” ([Deuteronomy 6:5](https://ref.ly/Deut6:5); [Matthew 22:37](https://ref.ly/Matt22:37); [Mark 12:30](https://ref.ly/Mark12:30); [Luke 10:27](https://ref.ly/Luke10:27)).
* “Love your neighbor as yourself” ([Leviticus 19:18](https://ref.ly/Lev19:18); [Matthew 19:19](https://ref.ly/Matt19:19); [Mark 12:31](https://ref.ly/Mark12:31); [Luke 10:27](https://ref.ly/Luke10:27)).

We can see these two laws in the positive commands of the Ten Commandments ([Exodus 20:2–17](https://ref.ly/Exod20:2-Exod20:17); [Deuteronomy 5:6–21](https://ref.ly/Deut5:6-Deut5:21)): 

* “Remember the Sabbath day”
* “Honor your father and mother”

The negative commands make a boundary between good and evil. The first two of the Ten Commandments are key: 

* “You shall have no other gods before Me” ([Exodus 20:3](https://ref.ly/Exod20:3)).
* “You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything … You shall not bow down to them or worship them” ([Exodus 20:4–5](https://ref.ly/Exod20:4-Exod20:5)).

These forbidden actions go against the basic command to love God.

The prophets' books show that God uses these laws to judge the Israelites' actions. God also uses them to judge any ruler, group, or person at any time or place. Those who violate these main laws reject the one true God. This leads to divine judgment and disasters for sinners.
