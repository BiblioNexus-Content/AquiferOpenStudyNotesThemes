## Wealth and Poverty in the Wisdom Literature (id: 500281)

The sayings in Scripture about wealth and poverty, especially in the wisdom literature, show a broad truth. God blesses wise people with wealth, which makes life's challenges easier to handle ([Proverbs 3:9–10](https://ref.ly/Prov3:9-Prov3:10), [15–16](https://ref.ly/Prov3:15-Prov3:16); [10:22](https://ref.ly/Prov10:22); [10:15](https://ref.ly/Prov10:15)). Foolish behavior, especially laziness, often leads to poverty (see [10:4](https://ref.ly/Prov10:4)).

The book of Proverbs acknowledges that some evil people who are foolish are wealthy, but it reminds us that this wealth will not last long ([Proverbs 11:18](https://ref.ly/Prov11:18); [13:11](https://ref.ly/Prov13:11)). Poverty can sometimes result from injustice rather than foolishness ([13:23](https://ref.ly/Prov13:23)). Wealth can come from injustice and dishonesty ([16:8](https://ref.ly/Prov16:8)). Those with wealth need to use it wisely, including being generous to those in need ([28:27](https://ref.ly/Prov28:27); [29:7](https://ref.ly/Prov29:7), [14](https://ref.ly/Prov29:14)).

Wealth has limited benefits. Sometimes, it creates problems instead of solving them ([Proverbs 11:4](https://ref.ly/Prov11:4); [13:8](https://ref.ly/Prov13:8)). Wisdom can help in ways that wealth cannot, making wisdom more important than money ([15:16–17](https://ref.ly/Prov15:16-Prov15:17); [16:8](https://ref.ly/Prov16:8), [16](https://ref.ly/Prov16:16)).

God often blesses people who live to please him by providing what they need. When this happens, these people can then help others by sharing what they have received. This giving to others is itself another blessing from God. Yet, circumstances are not always fair. Sometimes, wealth does not go to those who deserve it (see [Ecclesiastes 9:11](https://ref.ly/Eccl9:11)). It does not always bring happiness (see [Ecclesiastes 2:17–23](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:17-Eccl2:23); [5:10–17](https://ref.ly/Eccl5:10-Eccl5:17)). In fact, money can harm faith ([1 Timothy 6:10](https://ref.ly/1Tim6:10); [James 2:1–13](https://ref.ly/Jas2:1-Jas2:13)). When choosing between living to please God and money, wise people will choose living to please God.
