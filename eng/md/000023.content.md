## Bribery and Gifts (id: 500282)

The Bible provides clear teachings about bribes (payments given to unfairly influence decisions) and gifts (offerings given to show respect or maintain relationships). Bribes are strongly condemned because they corrupt justice and lead to unfair treatment. For example, [Exodus 23:8](https://ref.ly/Exod23:8) commands, "Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds those who see and twists the words of the righteous" (see also [Deuteronomy 16:19](https://ref.ly/Deut16:19)).

The book of Proverbs includes several observations about how bribes and gifts operate in society. Some verses describe the effectiveness of bribes in achieving results ([Proverbs 17:8](https://ref.ly/Prov17:8); [18:16](https://ref.ly/Prov18:16)). These verses describe human behavior but do not endorse bribery.

Other verses in Proverbs explicitly show that bribery is wrong, especially when it corrupts justice ([Proverbs 15:27](https://ref.ly/Prov15:27); [17:23](https://ref.ly/Prov17:23)).

The Bible distinguishes between bribes and legitimate gifts. Bribes are secret payments meant to gain unfair advantages or pervert justice. Gifts, however, are often given openly to show respect, maintain relationships, or follow cultural customs of hospitality. For example, in [Genesis 32:20](https://ref.ly/Gen32:20), Jacob sends gifts to Esau to mend their relationship. Similarly, [1 Samuel 10:27](https://ref.ly/1Sam10:27) describes people bringing gifts to honor Saul as their new king.

While the Bible recognizes the cultural role of gifts, it consistently condemns bribery, emphasizing justice, fairness, and integrity.
