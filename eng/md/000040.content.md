## Compassionate Healer (id: 500344)

The New Testament often describes Jesus as someone who "had compassion." This phrase is sometimes translated as "felt sorry" or "took pity." 

It appears in complex situations where: 

1. Someone shows distress and Jesus resolves the distress ([Matthew 18:23–26](https://ref.ly/Matt18:23-Matt18:26); [20:29–33](https://ref.ly/Matt20:29-Matt20:33); [Matthew 18:27](https://ref.ly/Matt18:27); [20:34](https://ref.ly/Matt20:34)).
2. Jesus displays deep emotion ([Matthew 14:14](https://ref.ly/Matt14:14); [15:32](https://ref.ly/Matt15:32); [18:27](https://ref.ly/Matt18:27); [20:34](https://ref.ly/Matt20:34)).
3. There is a contrast with those lacking compassion ([Matthew 9:32–36](https://ref.ly/Matt9:32-Matt9:36); [18:27–30](https://ref.ly/Matt18:27-Matt18:30); [20:29–34](https://ref.ly/Matt20:29-Matt20:34)).

In the Gospels, "had compassion" directly refers to Jesus, but it also appears in parables where it can refer to God the Father or Jesus ([Matthew 18:27](https://ref.ly/Matt18:27); [Luke 10:33](https://ref.ly/Luke10:33); [15:20](https://ref.ly/Luke15:20)).

In the Old Testament, God’s compassion refers to his tender mercy, most often toward his covenant people. God withdrew this compassion to judge Israel’s stubborn unfaithfulness ([Isaiah 27:11](https://ref.ly/Isa27:11); [63:15](https://ref.ly/Isa63:15); [Jeremiah 13:14](https://ref.ly/Jer13:14)). God restored his compassion when Israel repented ([Deuteronomy 13:18](https://ref.ly/Deut13:18); [30:2–3](https://ref.ly/Deut30:2-Deut30:3); [Proverbs 28:13](https://ref.ly/Prov28:13); [Isaiah 55:7](https://ref.ly/Isa55:7)). 

The Old Testament often describes the messianic age (the time when God's chosen leader would come) as a time of God’s compassion ([Isaiah 14:1](https://ref.ly/Isa14:1); [49:10](https://ref.ly/Isa49:10), [13](https://ref.ly/Isa49:13); [54:8](https://ref.ly/Isa54:8), [10](https://ref.ly/Isa54:10); [60:10](https://ref.ly/Isa60:10); [Jeremiah 12:15](https://ref.ly/Jer12:15); [33:26](https://ref.ly/Jer33:26); [Ezekiel 39:25](https://ref.ly/Ezek39:25); [Micah 7:19](https://ref.ly/Mic7:19); [Habakkuk 3:2](https://ref.ly/Hab3:2); [Zechariah 10:6](https://ref.ly/Zech10:6)). The Gospels show this idea again, as the messianic age has begun and God’s covenant love is active in Israel once again.
