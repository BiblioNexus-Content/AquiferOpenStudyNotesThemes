## Prayers for Vengeance (id: 500274)

Vengeance is punishment inflicted in return for a wrong suffered. It is the act of causing harm to someone as a response to harm they have caused. The writers of the psalms (called psalmists) sometimes asked God to punish their enemies. It was common for them to pray for the violent destruction of their enemies as a sign of God's justice. How can this type of prayer be acceptable?

These prayers for the destruction of the evil people come from a desire for justice and trust in God. [Psalm 1:6](https://ref.ly/Ps1:6) explains divine justice. God protects the righteous and destroys evil people. The evil people are corrupt and committed to what is wrong. They oppose God and everything God does. They oppose morals, society, and God's kingdom. 

The psalmists argued that evil does not align with God's nature. Removing evil is necessary for his kingdom to thrive. Yet, the poets of Israel did not call for God's judgment on anyone they disliked. Instead, the psalmists followed God's standards of justice and righteousness, which God expects all humans to follow.

The psalmists knew grief well. They suffered and experienced oppression from bullies, leaders, and kings both within and outside Israel. Their prayers were full of faith and hope. They questioned how long God would allow their suffering. They affirmed that only the Lord could save them from evil. 

They deeply longed for his redemption. They asked God to make the wicked suffer as they had, following the principle of revenge ([Psalm 5:10](https://ref.ly/Ps5:10); [6:10](https://ref.ly/Ps6:10); [7:9](https://ref.ly/Ps7:9); [9:19–20](https://ref.ly/Ps9:19-Ps9:20); [28:4](https://ref.ly/Ps28:4); [56:7](https://ref.ly/Ps56:7); [104:35](https://ref.ly/Ps104:35); [137:7–9](https://ref.ly/Ps137:7-Ps137:9); [139:19](https://ref.ly/Ps139:19)). Through these prayers for justice and salvation, the faithful can find peace as they wait for God’s rescue.

Do we truly see evil as evil, or do we think of it only as an inconvenience? It is right to pray for the end of evil as long as we recognize that God is the one who decides, judges, and carries out judgment. When we pray for God's Kingdom to come, we are also asking for evil to be removed.

But now the harsh punishment that was meant for sinful people has been changed through Jesus Christ's painful death on the cross. This action by God shows us how we should pray for those who oppose us. Jesus will indeed judge and bring a final end to evil (see [Revelation 19:11–21](https://ref.ly/Rev19:11-Rev19:21)). But while Christians wait for that final judgment, they are to love as Jesus loved ([John 13:34](https://ref.ly/John13:34)). They should pray for their enemies and forgive them ([Matthew 5:38–48](https://ref.ly/Matt5:38-Matt5:48); [Colossians 3:13](https://ref.ly/Col3:13)).
