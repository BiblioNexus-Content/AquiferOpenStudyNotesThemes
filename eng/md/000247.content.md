## The Old Realm and the New (id: 500394)

The Jewish people in Paul's time saw a clear difference between the "present evil age" and a "glorious age to come." Throughout [Romans 5–8](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1-Rom8:39), Paul uses these contrasting "realms" or "kingdoms" to explain our experience of salvation. 

The rulers of the old realm are: 

* death ([Romans 5:12–21](https://ref.ly/Rom5:12-Rom5:21));
* sin (chapter [6](https://ref.ly/Rom6:1-Rom6:23));
* the law (chapter [7](https://ref.ly/Rom7:1-Rom7:25)); and
* sinful nature ("the flesh" in [8:1–11](https://ref.ly/Rom8:1-Rom8:11)).

The new realm is characterized by:

* life ([Romans 5](https://ref.ly/Rom5:1-Rom5:21));
* righteous living (chapter [6](https://ref.ly/Rom6:1-Rom6:23));
* grace (chapter [6](https://ref.ly/Rom6:1-Rom6:23)); and
* the Holy Spirit (chapter [8](https://ref.ly/Rom8:1-Rom8:39)).

A person's future depends directly on which of these two realms they belong to.

Each realm has a leader representing its people. Adam, the first man, leads the old realm of sin and death. Christ leads the new realm of forgiveness and life. By nature, all humans belong to the old realm of sin and death, represented by Adam. His sin and death affect everyone's future ([Romans 5:12](https://ref.ly/Rom5:12), [18–19](https://ref.ly/Rom5:18-Rom5:19)). 

Those who have faith in God through Jesus move into the new realm of life. God appointed Jesus Christ as a "second Adam" (see [5:14](https://ref.ly/Rom5:14)). By obeying God and fulfilling his will, Jesus achieved a major victory over the realm of sin that Adam started ([5:18–19](https://ref.ly/Rom5:18-Rom5:19)). By accepting God's gift of grace, people choose Jesus as their leader and hope for eternal life ([5:17](https://ref.ly/Rom5:17)).

People in the new realm unite with Christ and enjoy the benefits of this union. They have "died with Christ," been "buried with Christ," and their current new life with Christ is an introduction to the day they will "live with Him" forever ([Romans 6:3–11](https://ref.ly/Rom6:3-Rom6:11)).
