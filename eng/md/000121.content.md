## Jesus’ Prayers (id: 500361)

In Luke’s gospel, Jesus prays during important moments in his life: 

1. At his baptism ([Luke 3:21](https://ref.ly/Luke3:21)).
2. Before choosing the twelve apostles ([6:12](https://ref.ly/Luke6:12)).
3. At the transfiguration, when Jesus' appearance changed to reveal his glory ([9:28–29](https://ref.ly/Luke9:28-Luke9:29)).
4. On behalf of Peter before he denied Christ ([22:32](https://ref.ly/Luke22:32))
5. On behalf of those who killed him while he hung on the cross ([23:34](https://ref.ly/Luke23:34))

Sometimes, Jesus went away from others to pray alone ([Matthew 14:23](https://ref.ly/Matt14:23); [Mark 1:35](https://ref.ly/Mark1:35); [Luke 5:16](https://ref.ly/Luke5:16)). He also taught the disciples how to pray ([Luke 11:1–4](https://ref.ly/Luke11:1-Luke11:4); see also [Matthew 6:5–13](https://ref.ly/Matt6:5-Matt6:13)). He shared stories about the importance of constant prayer ([Luke 11:5–13](https://ref.ly/Luke11:5-Luke11:13); [18:1–8](https://ref.ly/Luke18:1-Luke18:8)).

In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus’ prayers emphasize the intimate relationship between the Father and the Son. Jesus lived in harmony with his Father, followed his purpose, and remained faithful to his will. 

In Gethsemane, Jesus was deeply troubled about the suffering to come. But he prayed, “not My will, but Yours be done” ([Luke 22:42](https://ref.ly/Luke22:42)). On the cross, he showed complete trust in the Father. His last words were, “Father, into Your hands I commit My Spirit” ([Luke 23:46](https://ref.ly/Luke23:46)). Jesus showed us how to live a life of trust and dependence on our heavenly Father.

The apostle John writes about a prayer Jesus said on his last night with the disciples ([John 17:1–26](https://ref.ly/John17:1-John17:26)). This is often called the "high priestly prayer." In this prayer, Jesus prays to God on behalf of his followers. He asks God to protect them, help them understand, make them holy, and keep them united as one group.
