## Remove the Evil (id: 500193)

Sin is so opposed to God’s holiness that it cannot exist with him. The same should be true for God's people. God is holy, and he expects his people to show his holiness ([Leviticus 11:45](https://ref.ly/Lev11:45); [19:2](https://ref.ly/Lev19:2)).

God required severe responses to remove sin from the covenant community. God offered forgiveness, but only to those who were truly repentant. Those who became stubborn could expect God's judgment. This judgment was a cleansing process that consumed sinners and their sins, leaving nothing behind (see [Deuteronomy 9:3](https://ref.ly/Deut9:3); [13:5](https://ref.ly/Deut13:5); [Isaiah 33:14](https://ref.ly/Isa33:14); [Hebrews 12:28–29](https://ref.ly/Heb12:28-Heb12:29)). This cleansing is meant to heal the community of believers in the Lord and discourage others from rebelling against him ([Deuteronomy 17:13](https://ref.ly/Deut17:13)).

In the Old Testament, God often judged his people immediately (see, for example, [Numbers 11:1–3](https://ref.ly/Num11:1-Num11:3); [16:1–50](https://ref.ly/Num16:1-Num16:50); [Joshua 7](https://ref.ly/Josh7:1-Josh7:26)). This made his people very aware of his demand for obedience and the consequences of disobedience.

God's final punishment is set for the future day of justice when he will reveal and judge the sins of all people ([Romans 14:10](https://ref.ly/Rom14:10); [2 Corinthians 5:10](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:10); [Hebrews 9:27](https://ref.ly/Heb9:27); [1 Peter 4:5](https://ref.ly/1Pet4:5)). Yet, some disasters can be seen as God's judgment on his disobedient people (for example, [Acts 5:1–11](https://ref.ly/Acts5:1-Acts5:11); see [1 Corinthians 11:27–30](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:27-1Cor11:30)). It is still "a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God" ([Hebrews 10:31](https://ref.ly/Heb10:31)).
