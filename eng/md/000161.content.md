## Pure Worship (id: 500222)

From the start of God's relationship with Israel, he provided ways for their worship of him to be pleasing to him ([Exodus 20–40](https://ref.ly/Exod20:1-Exod40:38); [Leviticus 1–8](https://ref.ly/Lev1:1-Lev8:36)). One of the Lord's main goals for his people is to guarantee they offer him pure worship.

When King Solomon built the temple as a permanent place for worship, he carefully created "a house for the Name of the LORD my God" ([1 Kings 5:3–5](https://ref.ly/1Kgs5:3-1Kgs5:5)). He followed the given design, correctly placed the ark of the covenant in the inner holy place, and offered the temple to the Lord ([8:1–11](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:1-1Kgs8:11); see [Deuteronomy 16:13–17](https://ref.ly/Deut16:13-Deut16:17)). Solomon obeyed the law's rules (see, for example, [Exodus 25:10–22](https://ref.ly/Exod25:10-Exod25:22)). These rules intended to keep Israel's worship focused on the Lord and his commands.

People often worship based on their own desires instead of following God's instructions. Israel was no exception. In his later years, Solomon was unfaithful to the Lord by worshiping other gods ([1 Kings 11:4–8](https://ref.ly/1Kgs11:4-1Kgs11:8)). After Solomon died, Jeroboam created a rival, idol\-worshiping religion in the northern kingdom. He plainly violated God's law ([14:9–10](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:9-1Kgs14:10), [15–16](https://ref.ly/1Kgs14:15-1Kgs14:16)). 

False worship was common in the northern kingdom throughout its history (for example, [1 Kings 15:26](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:26); [16:13](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:13), [25–26](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:25-1Kgs16:26), [30–33](https://ref.ly/1Kgs16:30-1Kgs16:33); [21:25–26](https://ref.ly/1Kgs21:25-1Kgs21:26)). Meanwhile, in the southern kingdom of Judah, local pagan altars were a constant spiritual distraction ([15:14](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:14); [22:43](https://ref.ly/1Kgs22:43)). Neither Judah nor Israel were faithful in their worship of the Lord.

There is one God, and his people must worship only him ([1 Kings 8:23](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:23); see [Deuteronomy 5:7](https://ref.ly/Deut5:7), [9](https://ref.ly/Deut5:9); [6:4](https://ref.ly/Deut6:4); [John 14:6](https://ref.ly/John14:6); [Acts 4:12](https://ref.ly/Acts4:12)). Our worship must come from a pure heart. We must stay completely faithful to the Lord in committed service to him ([1 Kings 15:14](https://ref.ly/1Kgs15:14); [17:1](https://ref.ly/1Kgs17:1); see [Deuteronomy 10:12](https://ref.ly/Deut10:12), [20](https://ref.ly/Deut10:20); [Psalm 24:3–4](https://ref.ly/Ps24:3-Ps24:4); [Matthew 4:10](https://ref.ly/Matt4:10); [John 4:24](https://ref.ly/John4:24)). In our daily and weekly worship of God we should feel his presence, bringing genuine joy ([1 Kings 8:56](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:56); compare [Psalm 63:1–3](https://ref.ly/Ps63:1-Ps63:3); [Philippians 4:4](https://ref.ly/Phil4:4)). 

Israel’s temple was a holy place meant to attract all people to worship ([1 Kings 8:41–43](https://ref.ly/1Kgs8:41-1Kgs8:43)). So, Christians, who are the temple of the living God, should live in a way that attracts and motivates others to know the Lord and worship him ([1 Corinthians 3:16–17](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:16-1Cor3:17); [Matthew 5:16](https://ref.ly/Matt5:16); [Acts 2:40–47](https://ref.ly/Acts2:40-Acts2:47); [2 Timothy 4:5](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:5); [1 Peter 2:12](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:12)). Our whole lives should include daily worship of Christ, recognizing him as Lord ([1 Peter 3:15](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:15)). We must not let any idol take God's place in our lives ([1 John 5:21](https://ref.ly/1John5:21)).
