## Death (id: 500164)

Humans are mortal, and death is the natural end of life on earth ([Psalm 90:1–6](https://ref.ly/Ps90:1-Ps90:6)). Human identity began when God breathed life into the dust of the earth and made a man ([Genesis 2:7](https://ref.ly/Gen2:7)). This state reverses at death when God takes back his breath. Then the human body returns to dust ([3:19](https://ref.ly/Gen3:19); [Job 4:19–21](https://ref.ly/Job4:19-Job4:21); [Isaiah 40:6–8](https://ref.ly/Isa40:6-Isa40:8)). Human life fully depends on the creator. His breath is a gift that sustains us as long as he allows ([Psalm 104:29](https://ref.ly/Ps104:29)).

Sin brought death into human life and caused much harm. Death often comes without warning, making people feel very sad. When someone dies, it can feel like their hopes and plans for the future have ended. The death penalty is the strongest punishment that human courts can give. In the Old Testament, the death penalty was for crimes such as murder or blasphemy ([Genesis 9:6](https://ref.ly/Gen9:6); [Exodus 21:12](https://ref.ly/Exod21:12); [Leviticus 24:16](https://ref.ly/Lev24:16); [John 10:30–33](https://ref.ly/John10:30-John10:33)). These were crimes that endangered the community. 

In the Old Testament, *Sheol* is the opposite of "the land of the living" ([Psalm 27:13](https://ref.ly/Ps27:13)). This is the dark and silent place where dead people are ([Job 10:21–22](https://ref.ly/Job10:21-Job10:22); [Psalm 94:17](https://ref.ly/Ps94:17); [Jonah 2:6](https://ref.ly/Jonah2:6)). Even in death, God's people have hope (see [Proverbs 14:32](https://ref.ly/Prov14:32)). God is sovereign (in complete control) and rules over death ([Deuteronomy 32:39](https://ref.ly/Deut32:39)).

The Old Testament often describes death as joining one's ancestors, without mentioning resurrection (see, for example, [Genesis 49:29–33](https://ref.ly/Gen49:29-Gen49:33)). Yet, there are some hints of resurrection (see [Job 19:25–27](https://ref.ly/Job19:25-Job19:27); [Isaiah 25:6–9](https://ref.ly/Isa25:6-Isa25:9); [26:19](https://ref.ly/Isa26:19); [Daniel 12:2](https://ref.ly/Dan12:2)). Jewish belief in resurrection became more common during the period between the Old and New Testaments. 

Resurrection is a key theme in the New Testament. Through Christ, God's redeemed people will overcome death. Death is the last enemy God destroys ([1 Corinthians 15:54–57,](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:54-1Cor15:57) [26](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:26)). Death comes from sin ([Romans 5:12](https://ref.ly/Rom5:12)). Those who live in a sinful state and do not repent (turn away from sin) will experience punishment in the lake of fire, known as "the second death" ([Revelation 21:8](https://ref.ly/Rev21:8)). 

But Jesus' death defeated death. When Jesus died and rose again, he showed that death is not the final authority over humanity. His resurrection is a model for all Christians ([Colossians 1:18](https://ref.ly/Col1:18)). He is "the Lord of both the living and the dead" ([Romans 14:9](https://ref.ly/Rom14:9)). When someone dies, it is natural to mourn. But it should also be a time to show great trust in God. Those who receive God's promises have hope that they will live after the grave.
