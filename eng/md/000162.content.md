## Purim (id: 500250)

The Feast of Purim is the only Old Testament feast not established during the time of Moses. Its name comes from a word meaning *lots* or *dice* (Hebrew *purim*, from Akkadian *puru*). In ancient times, people often cast *purim* to see if God approved of an action. A good number meant approval, while a bad number meant disapproval. 

Near the king's throne room at Susa in Persia, archaeologists found a small four\-sided object with numbers on each side. A similar die with the word *pur* dates back to the 800s BC. In the book of Esther, Persian astrologers used *purim* to decide the best time to attack the Jews ([Esther 3:7](https://ref.ly/Esth3:7)).

On March 7, 473 BC, God saved his people from certain death, similar to the rescue from Egypt during Passover. Mordecai and Esther established an annual celebration to remember God's rescue for future generations ([Esther 9:28](https://ref.ly/Esth9:28)). Later in history, Jews widely celebrated the feast (see 2 Maccabees 15:36; Josephus, *Antiquities* 11\.6\.13; possibly [John 5:1](https://ref.ly/John5:1)).

When God saved his chosen people, the day intended for the destruction of the Jews became a day of their victory over their enemies. It was followed by celebration. Today, Jewish people fast and pray to remember how Queen Esther fasted before she bravely approached the king. This fast comes right before Purim, which happens on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar (in February or March). 

During the joyful holiday of Purim, Jews read the story of Esther, loudly booing Haman and cheering for Mordecai. They enjoy special meals, exchange food gifts with friends, and give to people in need. Purim celebrates how God protected the Jewish people from harm and shows how God continues to watch over and care for his people throughout history (see also [Genesis 45:5](https://ref.ly/Gen45:5); [Psalm 91](https://ref.ly/Ps91:1-Ps91:16); [Proverbs 16:9](https://ref.ly/Prov16:9), [33](https://ref.ly/Prov16:33); [Daniel 2:21](https://ref.ly/Dan2:21); [Acts 1:6–7](https://ref.ly/Acts1:6-Acts1:7); [2:22–23](https://ref.ly/Acts2:22-Acts2:23); [4:28–30](https://ref.ly/Acts4:28-Acts4:30); [17:24–27](https://ref.ly/Acts17:24-Acts17:27); [Romans 8:28](https://ref.ly/Rom8:28); [1 Peter 3:12](https://ref.ly/1Pet3:12)).
