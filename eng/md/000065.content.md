## Fearing People (id: 500291)

God promised to be with his people when they encountered opposition (see, for example, [Deuteronomy 20:1–4](https://ref.ly/Deut20:1-Deut20:4); [Joshua 1:9](https://ref.ly/Josh1:9)). As long as they remained committed to him, they had no reason to fear others. Israel's history showed this truth (see [Exodus 14:10–31](https://ref.ly/Exod14:10-Exod14:31); [Joshua 10:9–14](https://ref.ly/Josh10:9-Josh10:14)). Yet, for those who seek peace and security elsewhere, God can become "a rock of offense" instead of a "sanctuary" ([Isaiah 8:14](https://ref.ly/Isa8:14)).

During King Ahaz's rule in Judah, he became very afraid when he heard that Syria and Israel had joined to fight against him ([Isaiah 7:2](https://ref.ly/Isa7:2)). The Lord urged him to have faith, as faith was necessary for the Lord's protection ([7:9](https://ref.ly/Isa7:9)). Yet, Ahaz chose not to trust the Lord. Instead, he sought help from the Assyrians. This decision caused the Lord to become "a trap and a snare" for him and for all of Israel and Judah ([8:11–15](https://ref.ly/Isa8:11-Isa8:15)).

The prophet Isaiah's message intended to show the difference between faith and fear. King Ahaz is an example of fear. King Hezekiah is an imperfect example of faith ([Isaiah 37](https://ref.ly/Isa37:1-Isa37:38)). Isaiah himself is a better example of faith (chapter [8](https://ref.ly/Isa8:1-Isa8:22)). Finally, God's "Servant" is the ideal example of faith ([42:1–7](https://ref.ly/Isa42:1-Isa42:7); [50:4–7](https://ref.ly/Isa50:4-Isa50:7)).

Jesus told his followers not to fear people who threaten them, even those who want to kill them ([Matthew 10:26–31](https://ref.ly/Matt10:26-Matt10:31)). God knows every sparrow and the number of hairs on a person's head. God will be with those who trust in him. Christians have shown this trust throughout history by not fearing what others can do to them, even dying for their faith (see [Acts 6:8–7:60](https://ref.ly/Acts6:8-Acts7:60)).

People who do not fully commit to God will fear others. But those who trust in the Lord can overcome this fear. They understand that human enemies are temporary, while God's power lasts forever.
