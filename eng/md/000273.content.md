## The Superiority of the Son (id: 500429)

The book of Hebrews shows why Jesus, the Son of God, is greater than all others in who he is (his nature) and what he does (his ministry).

Superior in Nature
------------------

The Son's superior *nature* is mainly discussed in [Hebrews 1:1–3:6](https://ref.ly/Heb1:1-Heb3:6). In the book's introduction ([1:1–4](https://ref.ly/Heb1:1-Heb1:4)), the Son is shown as the creator, supporter, and heir of the universe ([1:2–3](https://ref.ly/Heb1:2-Heb1:3)). He is "the radiance of God’s glory and the exact representation of His nature" ([1:3](https://ref.ly/Heb1:3)). He is honored, having cleansed sins and has a status "far superior to the angels" ([1:3–4](https://ref.ly/Heb1:3-Heb1:4)).

Superior to Angels
------------------

In [Hebrews 1:5–14](https://ref.ly/Heb1:5-Heb1:14) and [2:5–18](https://ref.ly/Heb2:5-Heb2:18), the Son is shown to be greater than the angels. He has a special relationship with the Father ([1:5](https://ref.ly/Heb1:5)). He is the ruler, creator, and he who changer of the created world ([1:8–12](https://ref.ly/Heb1:8-Heb1:12)). The angels have a lower status than him, and they worship him ([1:6–7](https://ref.ly/Heb1:6-Heb1:7)). God the Father raises him to the highest position of honor at his right hand ([1:13](https://ref.ly/Heb1:13); [Psalm 110:1](https://ref.ly/Ps110:1)). He has authority over everything ([Hebrews 2:5–8](https://ref.ly/Heb2:5-Heb2:8)).

Superior to Moses
-----------------

In [Hebrews 3:1–6](https://ref.ly/Heb3:1-Heb3:6), the author uses the respect his audience has for Moses to argue for even greater respect for the Son. Like Moses, the Son was faithful in serving God's people. Yet, the Son deserves more glory and praise than Moses because he has the same nature as God the Father. The Son is the ultimate builder of God's house ([3:3–4](https://ref.ly/Heb3:3-Heb3:4)). The Son is ultimately in charge of God's people ([3:5–6](https://ref.ly/Heb3:5-Heb3:6)).

Superior Ministry
-----------------

### Superior Priest

The sections highlighting the Son's superior *ministry* are mainly in [Hebrews 7:1–10:18](https://ref.ly/Heb7:1-Heb10:18). Through his superior role as high priest, Jesus has introduced a "better hope" ([7:19](https://ref.ly/Heb7:19)). "A better covenant" guarantees this hope ([7:22](https://ref.ly/Heb7:22)). "Better promises" ground this hope ([8:6](https://ref.ly/Heb8:6)). This allows him to perform a ministry "more excellent" than that of the old covenant priests ([8:6](https://ref.ly/Heb8:6)). The old covenant was the agreement God made with the Israelites through Moses.

### Superior Sacrifice

Jesus' ministry under the new covenant is a better system because of his "better sacrifices" ([9:10](https://ref.ly/Heb9:10), [23](https://ref.ly/Heb9:23); see also [12:24](https://ref.ly/Heb12:24)). The new covenant is the new agreement God made through Jesus. Jesus' ministry leads new\-covenant believers in God to expect "a better and permanent possession" ([10:34](https://ref.ly/Heb10:34)). It is a "better country, a heavenly one" ([11:16](https://ref.ly/Heb11:16)). They will "gain a better resurrection" ([11:35](https://ref.ly/Heb11:35)). For believers in Jesus under the new covenant, God has "planned something better" that old\-covenant believers could only anticipate ([11:40](https://ref.ly/Heb11:40)).
