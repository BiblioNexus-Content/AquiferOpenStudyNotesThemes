## The Passover (id: 500174)

The feast of Passover became a central part of Israelite religious practice. This festival celebrated God's rescue of the Hebrews from Egypt and his protection from the final deadly plague. God wanted it observed every year, following the instructions in the book of Exodus ([Exodus 12:1–27](https://ref.ly/Exod12:1-Exod12:27)). Passover was a reminder for future generations of God's saving actions. All the people participated in the feast. They ate only unleavened bread, just as they did when they quickly left Egypt.

During the first Passover, they sacrificed a lamb to save the firstborn son of each Israelite family ([Exodus 12:12–13](https://ref.ly/Exod12:12-Exod12:13), [23](https://ref.ly/Exod12:23)). Passover represents that we can escape death only through a sacrifice that substitutes for us. Passover was an important event in Israelite history. But the exodus from Egypt did not solve the universal problem of death, which comes from sin ([1 Corinthians 15:56](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:56)).

Many years later, during the Passover feast, Jesus Christ gave his "life as a ransom for many" ([Matthew 20:28](https://ref.ly/Matt20:28); [Mark 10:45](https://ref.ly/Mark10:45)). He became "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" ([John 1:29](https://ref.ly/John1:29)). While sharing a final Passover meal with his disciples, Jesus explained the symbolic meaning of the wine they shared: "This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins" ([Matthew 26:28](https://ref.ly/Matt26:28)). He represents and begins a new Passover. Jesus completely and finally defeated sin and death through his sacrifice (see also [Isaiah 25:7–8](https://ref.ly/Isa25:7-Isa25:8)).
