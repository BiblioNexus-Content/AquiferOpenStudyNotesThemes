## Messages Against the Nations (id: 500316)

Why did Israel’s prophets speak to nations who were unlikely to hear their messages? Why did the prophets care about these nations' thoughts and actions?

The real audience was God's people. These messages reminded them that God does not have a double standard. He judges the sins of his people and those of other nations. Judgment begins "with the family of God" ([1 Peter 4:17](https://ref.ly/1Pet4:17)). 

But it does not stop there. God will judge everyone, both inside and outside Israel, who rebels against him. Everyone must recognize the Lord as the one true and sovereign God.

The people of Judah often trusted nations like Egypt to save them from foreign enemies. They did not realize that God used other nations to judge them. The prophets reminded the people that no nation on earth can replace God. In the end, all nations will bow before him in worship.

The messages against foreign nations reminded the covenant community that even though God judged them for their sins, they remained his precious people. The main accusation against these foreign nations was that they persecuted and insulted God's chosen people. This offended God. The negative part of God's covenant with Abraham was still active. God says he will “curse those who curse you” ([Genesis 12:3](https://ref.ly/Gen12:3)).

God's main goal in history is to bring glory to himself. By exiling his sinful people and judging their arrogant oppressors, God showed his power and holiness. Despite the exile to Babylon, there was still hope for the positive side of the covenant to be fulfilled: “all the families of the earth will be blessed through you” ([Genesis 12:3](https://ref.ly/Gen12:3); see also [Romans 11:1–27](https://ref.ly/Rom11:1-Rom11:27)). God had not finished the plans for his people. He would ultimately glorify himself by returning them from the distant lands where he had scattered them.
