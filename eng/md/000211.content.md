## The Coming of God’s Kingdom (id: 500350)

A key part of Jesus' message was that God's kingdom had come. The people of Israel eagerly awaited this reality. It would fulfill God's many promises that had not yet become a reality:

* The Holy Spirit would return, as the Spirit had in the past. And God would "pour out" his Spirit on each Christian, fulfilling [Joel 2:28–32](https://ref.ly/Joel2:28-Joel2:32) (see [Acts 2:16–21](https://ref.ly/Acts2:16-Acts2:21)). This means that the Holy Spirit would be given to all believers, not just to special leaders as in Old Testament times.
* Jesus would defeat Satan ([Mark 3:27](https://ref.ly/Mark3:27); [Luke 10:17–18](https://ref.ly/Luke10:17-Luke10:18)). This was already being shown when Jesus cast out demons ([Mark 1:21–28](https://ref.ly/Mark1:21-Mark1:28); [5:1–20](https://ref.ly/Mark5:1-Mark5:20); [Luke 11:20](https://ref.ly/Luke11:20)). Jesus' power over demons was a sign that he was beginning to overcome Satan's influence in the world.
* The new covenant promised in [Jeremiah 31:31–34](https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:34) would begin ([Mark 14:24](https://ref.ly/Mark14:24)). This new agreement between God and his people would replace the old covenant made at Mount Sinai.
* The resurrection from the dead would produce its "firstfruits" ([Mark 8:31](https://ref.ly/Mark8:31); [9:9](https://ref.ly/Mark9:9), [31](https://ref.ly/Mark9:31); [10:33–34](https://ref.ly/Mark10:33-Mark10:34); [16:6](https://ref.ly/Mark16:6); [1 Corinthians 15:20](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:20), [23](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:23)). This means that Jesus would be the first to rise from the dead with a glorified body, beginning the process that will eventually include all believers.
* God's Anointed, the promised Son of David would come ([Matthew 2:1–12](https://ref.ly/Matt2:1-Matt2:12); [Luke 2:25–38](https://ref.ly/Luke2:25-Luke2:38)). This refers to the Messiah (or Christ), the special leader God promised to send who would be a descendant of King David.

Jesus's birth, ministry, death, resurrection, and ascension fulfilled these aspects of God’s kingdom. People must repent and trust in the gospel (good news) because God’s kingdom has come in Jesus ([Matthew 4:23](https://ref.ly/Matt4:23); [6:10](https://ref.ly/Matt6:10); [Mark 1:14–15](https://ref.ly/Mark1:14-Mark1:15); [4:26–32](https://ref.ly/Mark4:26-Mark4:32); [Luke 4:42–43](https://ref.ly/Luke4:42-Luke4:43)).

When Jesus began the kingdom, everything changed in Israel. The Holy Spirit was active again, working through John the Baptist and Jesus. For those who understood, the promised Christ, or Messiah, had arrived. Because God's kingdom was present in Jesus, the disciples did not fast like the Pharisees and John's disciples ([Mark 2:18–20](https://ref.ly/Mark2:18-Mark2:20)). Fasting was not suitable because Old Testament promises were becoming fulfilled. 

It was a time for celebration and feasting ([Mark 2:19–20](https://ref.ly/Mark2:19-Mark2:20)). This was because God's rule had started. People were already entering the kingdom and experiencing its signs ([10:23–31](https://ref.ly/Mark10:23-Mark10:31); [9:1](https://ref.ly/Mark9:1)).

A future aspect of God's kingdom will happen when Jesus returns ([Mark 14:25](https://ref.ly/Mark14:25)). At that time, God will judge evil and fully establish justice. Disease, poverty, and death will end. Jesus, the Son of Man, will return in glory and gather his chosen ones ([Mark 13:24–27](https://ref.ly/Mark13:24-Mark13:27); [Titus 2:11–14](https://ref.ly/Titus2:11-Titus2:14)). 

He will judge the world ([Mark 8:38](https://ref.ly/Mark8:38); [14:62](https://ref.ly/Mark14:62); [Matthew 25:31–46](https://ref.ly/Matt25:31-Matt25:46); [2 Timothy 4:1](https://ref.ly/2Tim4:1); [Revelation 14:14–20](https://ref.ly/Rev14:14-Rev14:20)). He will resurrect the dead ([1 Corinthians 15:12–57](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:12-1Cor15:57); [1 Thessalonians 4:13–5:11](https://ref.ly/1Thess4:13-1Thess5:11)). No one knows when Jesus will return ([Mark 13:32](https://ref.ly/Mark13:32)). His followers should stay spiritually alert and watch for his coming as they await "the blessed hope" ([13:33–37](https://ref.ly/Mark13:33-Mark13:37); [Titus 2:13](https://ref.ly/Titus2:13)).
