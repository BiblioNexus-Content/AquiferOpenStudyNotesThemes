## Praise and Rejoicing in Luke–Acts (id: 500357)

In Luke's Gospel, those who receive God's grace praise him for his wonderful acts ([Luke 1:44](https://ref.ly/Luke1:44), [46](https://ref.ly/Luke1:46), [64](https://ref.ly/Luke1:64), [68](https://ref.ly/Luke1:68); [2:13](https://ref.ly/Luke2:13), [38](https://ref.ly/Luke2:38); [5:25–26](https://ref.ly/Luke5:25-Luke5:26); [7:16](https://ref.ly/Luke7:16); [13:13](https://ref.ly/Luke13:13); [17:15–18](https://ref.ly/Luke17:15-Luke17:18); [18:43](https://ref.ly/Luke18:43); [19:37](https://ref.ly/Luke19:37); [24:53](https://ref.ly/Luke24:53)). In the book of Acts, praise follows healings and the salvation of non\-Jews (gentiles) ([3:8–9](https://ref.ly/Acts3:8-Acts3:9); [4:21–22](https://ref.ly/Acts4:21-Acts4:22); [Acts 11:18](https://ref.ly/Acts11:18); [13:48](https://ref.ly/Acts13:48); [21:19–20](https://ref.ly/Acts21:19-Acts21:20)).

This theme of praise closely links to a key idea in Luke's Gospel. The fulfillment of God's promise through Jesus the Messiah brings joy. This idea appears early in the book in the songs of Mary and Zechariah ([Luke 1:46–55,](https://ref.ly/Luke1:46-Luke1:55) [67–79](https://ref.ly/Luke1:67-Luke1:79)). The Old Testament prophets predicted that creation would sing when God's salvation arrived (see [Isaiah 55:12](https://ref.ly/Isa55:12)). 

When Jesus entered Jerusalem at the end of his ministry, his disciples shouted. They "began to praise God joyfully in a loud voice for all the miracles they had see" ([Luke 19:37](https://ref.ly/Luke19:37)). The Pharisees asked Jesus to silence his disciples. But he replied, "if they remain silent, the very stones will cry out" ([19:37–40](https://ref.ly/Luke19:37-Luke19:40)). 

At the end of the book, the disciples "returned to Jerusalem with great joy, praising God continually in the temple" ([24:52–53](https://ref.ly/Luke24:52-Luke24:53)). The arrival of God's marvelous salvation is a reason for joy and praise.
