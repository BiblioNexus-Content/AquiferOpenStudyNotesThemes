## The Household (id: 500425)

The household was the basic family unit of Greco\-Roman society. People believed that if households were stable, the state would also be stable. In these households, everyone had clear roles and responsibilities that were deeply embedded in their culture. The main goal was to keep the "natural" order of authority and obedience. Breaking this order would lead to dishonor and corruption. 

In this system, the husband\-father\-master was in charge of everyone. Men controlled public spaces and government, while women managed the home. Greco\-Roman speakers often accused new foreign religions, like Christianity, of corrupting society by threatening the household structure.

The New Testament household codes were not new ideas (see [Ephesians 5:21–6:9](https://ref.ly/Eph5:21-Eph6:9); [Colossians 3:18–4:1](https://ref.ly/Col3:18-Col4:1); [1 Timothy 2:8–15](https://ref.ly/1Tim2:8-1Tim2:15); [5:1–2](https://ref.ly/1Tim5:1-1Tim5:2); [6:1–2](https://ref.ly/1Tim6:1-1Tim6:2); [Titus 2:1–3:8](https://ref.ly/Titus2:1-Titus3:8); [1 Peter 2:18–3:7](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:18-1Pet3:7)). The apostles adapted them to fit the Christian faith and address specific needs. The Christian faith often made major changes to the normal practices of culture. Yet, wisdom and carefulness were necessary. Ignoring the normal practices of culture could cause severe problems. This could bring dishonor, disgrace, and shame on the entire household—including Jesus, the head of the Christian household.

This was the effect of some false teachers in Ephesus, as discussed in the first letter to Timothy in the New Testament. In this context, the New Testament household codes helped Christian communities live in a way that: 

1. stopped accusations that Christianity threatened the state; and
2. served as a strong, attractive witness to the truth.
