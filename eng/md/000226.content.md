## The Growth of the Church (id: 500381)

The book of Acts describes the church's growth after the day of Pentecost. Initially, the church increased in numbers. After Jesus' ascension to heaven, only 120 Christians attended the first prayer meeting to seek divine guidance ([Acts 1:12–15](https://ref.ly/Acts1:12-Acts1:15)). After the Holy Spirit's powerful arrival on Pentecost, the number of Christians increased to about 3,000 ([2:41](https://ref.ly/Acts2:41)). Many more accepted Peter and John's preaching of the good news about Jesus (the gospel), increasing the number to about 5,000 ([4:4](https://ref.ly/Acts4:4)). The church continued to increase ([5:14](https://ref.ly/Acts5:14); [6:1](https://ref.ly/Acts6:1); [9:31](https://ref.ly/Acts9:31); [21:20](https://ref.ly/Acts21:20)).

There is also plain evidence of geographical spread (see [Acts 1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8); [9:15](https://ref.ly/Acts9:15)). The church was not only in Jerusalem. The gospel message spread to Lydda, Sharon, and Joppa on the Mediterranean coast ([9:32–43](https://ref.ly/Acts9:32-Acts9:43)). The message of salvation in Christ also expanded from its Jewish base into Samaria ([8:4–12](https://ref.ly/Acts8:4-Acts8:12)). 

Then it spread into Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch ([11:19–26](https://ref.ly/Acts11:19-Acts11:26)). As Peter declared to the household of the Roman centurion Cornelius, “God does not show favoritism” ([10:34](https://ref.ly/Acts10:34)). The message of "the gospel of peace through Jesus Christ" is for everyone ([10:36](https://ref.ly/Acts10:36)).

As the Christian faith increased in numbers and spread geographically, Christian communities also experienced deeper spiritual growth. [Acts 2:42–47](https://ref.ly/Acts2:42-Acts2:47) shows this development in the church's inner life. It emphasizes united prayer during crises, generous sharing, courage in persecution, and bold witnessing ([4:23–31](https://ref.ly/Acts4:23-Acts4:31), [32–37](https://ref.ly/Acts4:32-Acts4:37); [5:27–33](https://ref.ly/Acts5:27-Acts5:33), [40–42](https://ref.ly/Acts5:40-Acts5:42); [16:19–25](https://ref.ly/Acts16:19-Acts16:25)). The preaching of the deacon and evangelist Philip, the deacon Stephen’s manner of dying, and the behavior of the apostles Paul and Silas in prison showed great spiritual maturity ([7:59–60](https://ref.ly/Acts7:59-Acts7:60); [8:4–40](https://ref.ly/Acts8:4-Acts8:40); [16:19–25](https://ref.ly/Acts16:19-Acts16:25)). 

Church leaders encouraged Christians, strengthened their faith, and helped them endure persecution ([14:22](https://ref.ly/Acts14:22); [15:32](https://ref.ly/Acts15:32), [41](https://ref.ly/Acts15:41); [18:23](https://ref.ly/Acts18:23); see [2 Timothy 1:8](https://ref.ly/2Tim1:8); [2:1–9](https://ref.ly/2Tim2:1-2Tim2:9); [3:12](https://ref.ly/2Tim3:12)). They lived by the standards they set for others ([1 Corinthians 4:16](https://ref.ly/1Cor4:16), [20](https://ref.ly/1Cor4:20); [Philippians 4:9](https://ref.ly/Phil4:9); [1 Thessalonians 1:5–8](https://ref.ly/1Thess1:5-1Thess1:8); [2 Thessalonians 3:9](https://ref.ly/2Thess3:9)). The church's careful inclusion of non\-Jewish people (gentiles) caused important spiritual and numerical growth. “So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers” ([Acts 16:5](https://ref.ly/Acts16:5)).
