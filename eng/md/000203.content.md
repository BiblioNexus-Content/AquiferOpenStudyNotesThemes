## The Christ Hymn: Christ’s Divine Nature (id: 500417)

The passage in [Philippians 2:6–11](https://ref.ly/Phil2:6-Phil2:11) is often called the Christ Hymn. This section reveals what early Christians believed about Jesus Christ. The hymn shows that early Christians believed Jesus existed before his birth on earth and that he has a divine nature (see also [Colossians 1:15–20](https://ref.ly/Col1:15-Col1:20); [2:9](https://ref.ly/Col2:9); compare [John 1:1–2](https://ref.ly/John1:1-John1:2); [Hebrews 1:1–3](https://ref.ly/Heb1:1-Heb1:3)). 

The hymn teaches that Christ is not just another human prophet. He was with God the Father from the beginning. He is the one through whom God created the universe. As the Son of God, Jesus shares God's own nature. 

This claim about Jesus being divine caused major disagreements between Jesus and the religious leaders of his time. They accused Jesus of blasphemy (speaking in a way that dishonors God) when he claimed to be equal with God ([John 5:16–18](https://ref.ly/John5:16-John5:18); [8:54–59](https://ref.ly/John8:54-John8:59); [10:30–39](https://ref.ly/John10:30-John10:39)).

The hymn also teaches that Jesus Christ came to earth in an act of great humility. The infinite God (who is eternal and not bound by time) took on human nature in the person of Jesus Christ and entered human history ([Philippians 2:7](https://ref.ly/Phil2:7); see [Colossians 1:15](https://ref.ly/Col1:15); [John 1:10–14](https://ref.ly/John1:10-John1:14); [Hebrews 2:14](https://ref.ly/Heb2:14), [17](https://ref.ly/Heb2:17)). Jesus Christ, the glorious Creator of the universe, died as a sacrifice for the sins of human beings. This was to secure forgiveness and reconcile humanity with God ([Philippians 2:8](https://ref.ly/Phil2:8); see [John 3:14–17](https://ref.ly/John3:14-John3:17); [Romans 5:9–10](https://ref.ly/Rom5:9-Rom5:10); [Colossians 1:20](https://ref.ly/Col1:20), [22](https://ref.ly/Col1:22); [2:13–14](https://ref.ly/Col2:13-Col2:14); [Hebrews 1:3](https://ref.ly/Heb1:3); [10:9–14](https://ref.ly/Heb10:9-Heb10:14)). The Scriptures had prophesied this very thing (see [Isaiah 53:3–12](https://ref.ly/Isa53:3-Isa53:12)).

This hymn states that God raised Jesus from the dead and gave him the highest honor in heaven ([Philippians 2:9](https://ref.ly/Phil2:9)). God also gave him the title "Lord" ([Philippians 2:11](https://ref.ly/Phil2:11); compare [Colossians 1:18](https://ref.ly/Col1:18)). One day, all created beings will bow before him and acknowledge him as Lord of the universe ([Philippians 2:9–11](https://ref.ly/Phil2:9-Phil2:11)). He deserves the worship that only God is worthy to receive (see [Revelation 5:8–14](https://ref.ly/Rev5:8-Rev5:14)).
