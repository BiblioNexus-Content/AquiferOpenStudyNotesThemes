## Giving up Rights (id: 500401)

The apostle Paul never tells Christians to defend their rights. Instead, he emphasizes that Christians should be willing to give up their rights for the benefit of others. Christians are free from many rules that others follow. But they should be ready to give up their freedoms if their actions might lead someone else to sin ([Romans 14:13–23](https://ref.ly/Rom14:13-Rom14:23); [1 Corinthians 8:1–13](https://ref.ly/1Cor8:1-1Cor8:13); [10:23–33](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:23-1Cor10:33)). Paul sees little value in defending personal rights.

Paul, like Jesus, views loving others as a key principle in life ([Romans 13:8–10](https://ref.ly/Rom13:8-Rom13:10); [1 Corinthians 13:1–13](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:1-1Cor13:13); [Galatians 5:6](https://ref.ly/Gal5:6); see [Matthew 5:43–44](https://ref.ly/Matt5:43-Matt5:44); [22:36–39](https://ref.ly/Matt22:36-Matt22:39)). True Christian love is always sacrificial, like Christ’s love ([1 Corinthians 13:4–7](https://ref.ly/1Cor13:4-1Cor13:7)). Christians should focus on what is best for others, not themselves ([1 Corinthians 10:32–33](https://ref.ly/1Cor10:32-1Cor10:33)). Christ's sacrificial death for sinners shows the nature of true love ([Romans 5:6–8](https://ref.ly/Rom5:6-Rom5:8); [15:1–5](https://ref.ly/Rom15:1-Rom15:5); [1 John 4:9–12](https://ref.ly/1John4:9-1John4:12)). A Christian’s life should express Christ’s sacrificial love. This is challenging because it requires people to deny their own desires (see [Mark 8:34–35](https://ref.ly/Mark8:34-Mark8:35)).
