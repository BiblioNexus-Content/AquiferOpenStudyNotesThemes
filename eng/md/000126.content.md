## Knowing God (id: 500326)

We often think of knowledge as information, facts, and concepts. In biblical times, knowledge focused on personal relationships. To know someone meant having a close relationship with them. Knowing God involves more than just learning facts about him. It goes beyond discussing God's nature and character, though those things are important. 

Knowing God means forming a close relationship with him. It involves seeing things as God does and learning to imitate him. Knowing God changes our thoughts, actions, priorities, values, and relationships with others. It is more important than religious ceremonies, sacrifices, or any other religious activities (see [Jeremiah 9:23–24](https://ref.ly/Jer9:23-Jer9:24); [31:34](https://ref.ly/Jer31:34)).

The prophet Hosea emphasizes the importance of knowing God. He shows that God would destroy Israel because they did not know God ([Hosea 4:1,](https://ref.ly/Hos4:1)[6](https://ref.ly/Hos4:6)). 

This theme is also common in the New Testament Gospel of John. Jesus often emphasizes the need to know God. He affirms that people can engage in religious practices but lack a true relationship with God (see [John 7:25–29](https://ref.ly/John7:25-John7:29); [8:14–19](https://ref.ly/John8:14-John8:19), [54–55](https://ref.ly/John8:54-John8:55); [14:6–11](https://ref.ly/John14:6-John14:11); [17:1–3](https://ref.ly/John17:1-John17:3)).
