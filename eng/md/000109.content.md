## Hope for the Messiah (id: 500359)

In the first century, many Jews hoped the Messiah (God's chosen one) would come. They thought this rescuer would defeat Israel's enemies and bring peace and prosperity to God's people.

The Hebrew word "Messiah" and the Greek word "Christ" both mean "anointed one." This term comes from the tradition of anointing Israelite kings with oil at their coronation. This act confirmed their role as God's representative to rule the nation. Later, the term referred to the future king for which Israel hoped. 

Many people hoped for a king from David's family line to restore David's dynasty and rule with righteousness and justice in Jerusalem. This hope came from the special agreement (the covenant) God made in [2 Samuel 7:11–16](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:11-2Sam7:16). God promised King David that his descendants would rule forever. As Israel's kingdom decreased and eventually ended, Old Testament prophets predicted the coming of the Christ ([Isaiah 9:6–7](https://ref.ly/Isa9:6-Isa9:7); [11:1–5](https://ref.ly/Isa11:1-Isa11:5); [Jeremiah 23:5–6](https://ref.ly/Jer23:5-Jer23:6); [33:15–16](https://ref.ly/Jer33:15-Jer33:16); [Ezekiel 37:24–25](https://ref.ly/Ezek37:24-Ezek37:25)). This Christ would rescue God's people and rule forever as David's successor.

The gospel writers focus on showing that Jesus is the promised Christ (see, for example, [Matthew 1:21–23](https://ref.ly/Matt1:21-Matt1:23); [Luke 1:32–33](https://ref.ly/Luke1:32-Luke1:33), [69–70](https://ref.ly/Luke1:69-Luke1:70)). Yet, he fulfilled these promises in an unexpected way. After Peter said Jesus is “The Christ of God,” Jesus began teaching about the Christ's suffering ([Luke 9:20–22](https://ref.ly/Luke9:20-Luke9:22)). As Jesus neared Jerusalem for the last time, people recognized him as, "the King who comes in the name of the Lord" ([Luke 18:36–38](https://ref.ly/Luke18:36-Luke18:38); [19:36–38](https://ref.ly/Luke19:36-Luke19:38)). Yet, later these same people rejected him ([Luke 22:66–71](https://ref.ly/Luke22:66-Luke22:71)). They crucified and mocked him as “THE KING OF THE JEWS” and “the Christ of God” ([Luke 23:35–39](https://ref.ly/Luke23:35-Luke23:39)).

On the third day, Jesus rose from the dead just as he said he would. During his appearances to the disciples, he explained that the Scriptures always prophesied that the Christ (or Messiah) would have to "suffer these things and then to enter His glory" ([Luke 24:26](https://ref.ly/Luke24:26)). Jesus' death and resurrection confirm that he is truly the Christ. His death brings "repentance and forgiveness of sins" ([24:46–47](https://ref.ly/Luke24:46-Luke24:47)).
