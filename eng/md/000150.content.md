## Paul’s Role as an Apostle (id: 500410)

To understand Paul's role as an apostle of Jesus Christ, a good place to read is the description in the second letter to the Corinthians. In this letter, Paul shares the core of his ministry. Paul was God's special messenger to establish and care for churches in the non\-Jewish (gentiles) world. He served with seriousness and sincerity. His message dealt with life and death issues ([2 Corinthians 2:15–17](https://ref.ly/2Cor2:15-2Cor2:17)). As an early Christian missionary, he brought the good news about Jesus (the gospel) to places where people had not heard about Jesus (see [Romans 15:20–21](https://ref.ly/Rom15:20-Rom15:21)).

Paul's message of good news was plain and direct (see, for example, [2 Corinthians 5:1–21](https://ref.ly/2Cor5:1-2Cor5:21)). He modeled it by his own life. He always intended to serve with truth and honesty ([2:17](https://ref.ly/2Cor2:17); [4:2](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:2)). As Paul shared the message of Christ, the self\-sacrifice of Christ's cross was his pattern of service to others ([11:16–33](https://ref.ly/2Cor11:16-2Cor11:33)).

Some people questioned Paul's authority. So he shared how God called him to be an apostle and established his ministry in Corinth ([2 Corinthians 10:12–18](https://ref.ly/2Cor10:12-2Cor10:18)). Some wanted proof that Christ choose him and criticized Paul's weaknesses ([13:3](https://ref.ly/2Cor13:3)). So, he pointed to the cross of Jesus and the lessons he learned from it (see [13:4](https://ref.ly/2Cor13:4); [4:10](https://ref.ly/2Cor4:10)). Paul knew his own limitations and that he needed God's grace to do his work. An apostle's true authority shows itself in human weakness supported by God's strength ([12:1–10](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:1-2Cor12:10)).

Paul performed miraculous works to support his claim to apostleship ([Hebrews 12:12](https://ref.ly/2Cor12:12)). Yet, these works did not stop doubts among the young church at Corinth. Paul showed great patience in his ministry and did not give up when the Corinthians challenged him. This patience mirrors that of Jesus, who encountered much opposition from others ([Hebrews 12:2–3](https://ref.ly/Heb12:2-Heb12:3)).

Paul’s example offers lessons for everyone involved in Christian service: 

1. Christian leaders should regard criticism as an opportunity to evaluate themselves and check if any accusation is true.
2. Christian leaders should remain patient when encountering undeserved opposition and stay focused on their work.
3. It is important to provide a logical defense and explain one's motives, while also acknowledging that the Lord is the ultimate judge.
