## True Justice (id: 500194)

The community of God's people in Old Testament Israel had to care for widows, orphans, and foreigners ([Deuteronomy 27:19](https://ref.ly/Deut27:19)). God wanted the Israelites to represent his justice (see [10:17–19](https://ref.ly/Deut10:17-Deut10:19)). He wanted them to always remember that they had been slaves. He wanted them to remember that they were defenseless in Egypt (see [10:19](https://ref.ly/Deut10:19); [24:18–22](https://ref.ly/Deut24:18-Deut24:22)). As those who received God's constant love and faithfulness, how could they ignore the rights and needs of the weakest among them?

Every society has structures that separate the powerful from the weak and the important from the less important people. This was true for Old Testament Israel, even with its special role as "a holy nation" ([Exodus 19:6](https://ref.ly/Exod19:6)). Judges and officials were responsible for protecting the law. They might favor those with money, high status, or influence, especially if they offered bribes ([Deuteronomy 16:19](https://ref.ly/Deut16:19)). Yet, no one can bribe God and he treats all people fairly ([10:17](https://ref.ly/Deut10:17)). To God, the rich and poor, powerful and weak, honored and desperate are all the same.

The prophets of Israel knew the importance of fairness and justice. They often urged these principles in both community and national life ([Isaiah 1:17](https://ref.ly/Isa1:17); [10:1–4](https://ref.ly/Isa10:1-Isa10:4); [59:14–19](https://ref.ly/Isa59:14-Isa59:19); [Ezekiel 22:23–29](https://ref.ly/Ezek22:23-Ezek22:29); [Amos 2:6–8](https://ref.ly/Amos2:6-Amos2:8); [Habakkuk 1:4](https://ref.ly/Hab1:4)). The New Testament also commands for fair treatment of the poor and those without advantages. It mentions that God is not pleased when others ignore them ([Matthew 23:23](https://ref.ly/Matt23:23); [2 Corinthians 9:6–10](https://ref.ly/2Cor9:6-2Cor9:10); [James 2:1–7](https://ref.ly/Jas2:1-Jas2:7)).

Justice that does not follow God's standard is not true justice. Those who are unjust will encounter full punishment from the Judge of all the earth (see [Deuteronomy 25:13–16](https://ref.ly/Deut25:13-Deut25:16)).
