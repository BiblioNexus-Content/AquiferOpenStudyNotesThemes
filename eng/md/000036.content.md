## Citizenship in the Kingdom (id: 500341)

First\-century Jews wanted a king like David or leader like Judas Maccabeus to defeat their oppressors. Jesus' idea of the kingdom of God was very different from these hopes ([Matthew 5:43–48](https://ref.ly/Matt5:43-Matt5:48)).

The Gospel of Matthew shows Jesus as a unique teacher, and the sermon on the mount is his longest and most famous sermon. It is more than just a set of Jesus' teachings about right and wrong. It is a guide for living as a citizen in the kingdom of heaven.

Jesus described the kingdom of heaven as: 

1. a connection with God,
2. a change of heart, and
3. relationships with others.

This new message of the kingdom made a strong impact on those who listened to Jesus ([Matthew 7:28–29](https://ref.ly/Matt7:28-Matt7:29)).

People often make clear distinctions between these three areas, but all are always present. For example, Jesus' instruction on humility seems inward at first, but it also involves our attitude toward God and others ([Matthew 5:5](https://ref.ly/Matt5:5)). The command not to resist an evil person appears outward\-focused ([5:39](https://ref.ly/Matt5:39)). But it often requires active faith in God and inner strength. Jesus' instruction on prayer mainly concerns our relationship with God ([6:5–15](https://ref.ly/Matt6:5-Matt6:15)). But prayer starts with understanding that you need God's help. It also often involves your relationships with other people

To be a citizen in the kingdom of heaven, you must follow Jesus and live a God\-centered life, not a self\-centered one. Trying to be righteous on your own keeps you in darkness because it is still self\-focused. Jesus calls for true righteousness, which is the righteousness of God himself ([Matthew 5:20](https://ref.ly/Matt5:20), [48](https://ref.ly/Matt5:48)). You cannot achieve this righteousness on your own. Jesus gives it to those who follow him.
