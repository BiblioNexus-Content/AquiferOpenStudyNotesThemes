## Pride and Humility (id: 500285)

Pride is a feeling people naturally have when they succeed or achieve something. Many people in the world value being recognized and famous (see [1 John 2:16](https://ref.ly/1John2:16)). However, pride comes from thinking too much about yourself, and often leads to making others seem less important. The Bible often warns against pride and the harm it can cause. Instead, the Bible encourages people to be humble.

The book of Proverbs connects humility with wisdom (see [Proverbs 11:2](https://ref.ly/Prov11:2)). Wisdom begins with revering or fearing the Lord ([1:7](https://ref.ly/Prov1:7)). Wisdom recognizes God's power and importance. A humble person admits mistakes and accepts correction from others ([10:17](https://ref.ly/Prov10:17); [12:1](https://ref.ly/Prov12:1)). But pride can prevent learning from others. It can cause conflict ([13:10](https://ref.ly/Prov13:10)). It leads to disgrace ([11:2](https://ref.ly/Prov11:2)).

In the divine plan, pride leads to downfall and shame, while humility brings honor ([Proverbs 11:2](https://ref.ly/Prov11:2); [18:12](https://ref.ly/Prov18:12); [29:23](https://ref.ly/Prov29:23)). People asked Jesus, “Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” He indicated that the model was the pure humility of a child ([Matthew 18:1–5](https://ref.ly/Matt18:1-Matt18:5)). 

In another story, Jesus shared a parable comparing the proud prayer of a religious leader with the humble prayer of a tax collector. He concluded with the words, “For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted” ([Luke 18:9–14](https://ref.ly/Luke18:9-Luke18:14); see also [Matthew 23:8–12](https://ref.ly/Matt23:8-Matt23:12); [Luke 14:7–11](https://ref.ly/Luke14:7-Luke14:11)).

Jesus showed the ultimate example of humility. Even though he is God's son, "he did not consider equality with God something to be grasped." Instead, "taking the form of a servant," he "became obedient to death—even death on a cross" ([Philippians 2:6–8](https://ref.ly/Phil2:6-Phil2:8)). God commands us to humble ourselves with the same self\-sacrifice ([Philippians 2:3–5](https://ref.ly/Phil2:3-Phil2:5); [1 John 3:16](https://ref.ly/1John3:16)).
