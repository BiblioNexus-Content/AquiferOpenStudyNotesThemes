## Remaining in Christ (id: 500374)

The Greek term *menō*, often translated as “remain,” “stay,” or “abide,” appears often in Jesus’ teachings about deep, intimate, and lasting relationships. For example, Jesus said, “If you continue in \[*menō en*, ‘stay in’] My word, you are truly My disciples” ([John 8:31](https://ref.ly/John8:31)). This means the life of a follower of Jesus (a disciple) is fully shaped by Jesus’ message. 

Jesus also explained how the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son ([John 14:10–11](https://ref.ly/John14:10-John14:11)). In a similar way, when we remain in Jesus, the Son is in us, and we are in the Father and the Son ([17:21–23](https://ref.ly/John17:21-John17:23)). Both the Father and the Son come and make their "home" within disciples.

This mutual "living inside" shows what it means for a disciple to remain in Jesus. We cannot make our relationship permanent by ourselves. Only God's gracious action through his Holy Spirit makes the relationship lasting. Both God and the disciple must commit. The connection between God and the disciple is not temporary. It is a lasting and eternal relationship (see [1 John 2:14](https://ref.ly/1John2:14), [17](https://ref.ly/1John2:17)).
