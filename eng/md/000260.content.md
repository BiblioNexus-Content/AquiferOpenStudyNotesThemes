## The Return of God’s Presence with His People (id: 500334)

The descriptions of the Israelite exile include the terrible reality that, as part of his judgment, God removed his presence from his people and from the holy city of Jerusalem. This idea is most obviously present in a vision by the prophet Ezekiel. He saw God's glorious presence leaving the temple ([Ezekiel 10:1–22](https://ref.ly/Ezek10:1-Ezek10:22); [11:22–23](https://ref.ly/Ezek11:22-Ezek11:23)). The prophets talked about the future return of God's people to the land. They often mentioned the return of God's presence (see, for example, [Isaiah 52:7–8](https://ref.ly/Isa52:7-Isa52:8); [Ezekiel 43:1–9](https://ref.ly/Ezek43:1-Ezek43:9)).

The prophet Zechariah focused on the Lord returning to his people. He believed God would live among them again, and the Lord's glory would be in Jerusalem ([Zechariah 1:16](https://ref.ly/Zech1:16); [2:5](https://ref.ly/Zech2:5), [10–11](https://ref.ly/Zech2:10-Zech2:11); [8:3](https://ref.ly/Zech8:3), [23](https://ref.ly/Zech8:23)). God's presence would return when they rebuilt the temple. This would bring spiritual rebirth or newness and plenty of crops ([1:17](https://ref.ly/Zech1:17); [4:8–9](https://ref.ly/Zech4:8-Zech4:9); [6:15](https://ref.ly/Zech6:15); see also [Haggai 2:19](https://ref.ly/Hag2:19)). 

In the future, God's presence would save Jerusalem and Israel from enemies. The Lord would be king over the earth. Everyone would worship the one true God ([Zechariah 9:16](https://ref.ly/Zech9:16); [10:6](https://ref.ly/Zech10:6); [12:9](https://ref.ly/Zech12:9); [14:9](https://ref.ly/Zech14:9)). Both now and in the future, the Lord's return to Jerusalem linked to the work of God's Spirit ([4:6](https://ref.ly/Zech4:6); [12:10](https://ref.ly/Zech12:10); see also [Haggai 2:5](https://ref.ly/Hag2:5)).

Zechariah's promise of the Lord's presence in Jerusalem prophesied the arrival of Jesus the Messiah (God's chosen one). It emphasized the amazing mystery of God's Word becoming man and living among humanity ([John 1:14](https://ref.ly/John1:14)).
