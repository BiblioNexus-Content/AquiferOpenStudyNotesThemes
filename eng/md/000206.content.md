## The Church as God’s Temple (id: 500408)

The idea of the church as God's temple comes from the Old Testament. The kings David and Solomon received a promise that the temple in Jerusalem would be where God lived among his people (see [2 Samuel 7:12–16](https://ref.ly/2Sam7:12-2Sam7:16); [1 Kings 9:1–9](https://ref.ly/1Kgs9:1-1Kgs9:9)). Solomon finished the temple in 960 BC. The Babylonians destroyed it in 586 BC. But the prophets of Israel anticipated a new temple. They shared a hopeful message that God would live among his people again (see, for example, [Isaiah 56:7](https://ref.ly/Isa56:7); [Ezekiel 40–43](https://ref.ly/Ezek40:1-Ezek43:27)).

The Israelites rebuilt the temple in Jerusalem after the exile when they returned from Babylon. It reached its peak during Herod the Great's additions. But the arrival of Jesus Christ truly fulfilled the hopes of God's people (see [John 1:14](https://ref.ly/John1:14); [2:19–22](https://ref.ly/John2:19-John2:22); [4:21–24](https://ref.ly/John4:21-John4:24)). Jesus is God's temple, where God's holiness lives. God invites his people to join him. Therefore, God's people should be a holy temple, a home for the Holy Spirit (see [1 Corinthians 3:16–17](https://ref.ly/1Cor3:16-1Cor3:17); [6:19](https://ref.ly/1Cor6:19); [2 Corinthians 6:16](https://ref.ly/2Cor6:16); [Ephesians 2:21](https://ref.ly/Eph2:21); [1 Peter 2:5](https://ref.ly/1Pet2:5); [Revelation 3:12](https://ref.ly/Rev3:12)).

The apostle Paul urged Christians to understand their identity as God's holy people (called "saints" in [2 Corinthians 1:1](https://ref.ly/2Cor1:1)). They should avoid moral evil and commit themselves to holy living and service to God. Paul encourages Christians to "cleanse ourselves from everything that defiles body and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God" ([7:1](https://ref.ly/2Cor7:1)).
