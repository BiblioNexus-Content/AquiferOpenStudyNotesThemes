## The New Covenant (id: 500310)

A covenant is a formal agreement or promise made between two parties. In the Bible, covenants are special agreements between God and people. 

The old covenant refers to the agreement God made with the people of Israel at Mount Sinai after he rescued them from slavery in Egypt. The main promise of the covenant of Mount Sinai was, “I will take you as My own people, and I will be your God” ([Exodus 6:7](https://ref.ly/Exod6:7); see [Jeremiah 31:33](https://ref.ly/Jer31:33)). The relationship between God and his people in the Sinai covenant included laws carved in stone and a priestly class who managed all religious institutions and activities.

The new covenant is the agreement God made with people through Jesus Christ. The new covenant would differ from the old in a key way. The new covenant would no longer be external to the worshipers but would be written on their hearts ([Jeremiah 31:33](https://ref.ly/Jer31:33)). The old covenant's major weakness was its lack of power to help people obey its commands ([Romans 8:3](https://ref.ly/Rom8:3)). The new covenant would be placed inside people's hearts and minds through the power of the Holy Spirit ([Ezekiel 36:24–27](https://ref.ly/Ezek36:24-Ezek36:27)). 

Because of this, it would become possible for people everywhere (not just a few chosen ones) to fulfill God's covenant plan for life. This plan is summarized in the two "Great Commandments" ([Matthew 22:35–40](https://ref.ly/Matt22:35-Matt22:40)): 

1. "You shall love the LORD your God" ([Deuteronomy 6:5](https://ref.ly/Deut6:5)).
2. "Love your neighbor as yourself" ([Leviticus 19:18](https://ref.ly/Lev19:18)).

The new covenant would achieve what the old one intended but could not achieve. It would create new individuals and a new community. The goal is a deep transformation of sinners, starting with forgiveness of sins and leading to holiness shown by good works ([Ephesians 1:4](https://ref.ly/Eph1:4); [2:8–10](https://ref.ly/Eph2:8-Eph2:10)).

[Jeremiah 30–33](https://ref.ly/Jer30:1-Jer33:26) emphasizes a hopeful future for Israel. The key moment is when the Lord God promises a new covenant with his people ([31:31–34](https://ref.ly/Jer31:31-Jer31:34)). This passage points to Jesus of Nazareth, whose death would confirm this new covenant. Jesus connected the new covenant to himself during the communion ceremony ([Matthew 26:28](https://ref.ly/Matt26:28); [Mark 14:24](https://ref.ly/Mark14:24); [Luke 22:20](https://ref.ly/Luke22:20); see also [1 Corinthians 11:25](https://ref.ly/1Cor11:25); [2 Corinthians 3:6](https://ref.ly/2Cor3:6)). 

Jesus' death made him the mediator of the covenant for all who trust in him ([Hebrews 8:8–12](https://ref.ly/Heb8:8-Heb8:12); chapter [9](https://ref.ly/Jer9:1-Jer9:26)). Christians remember this truth each time they take Communion (also called the Lord's Supper or the Eucharist). According to the New Testament, all Christians will know God directly through the Holy Spirit, made possible by Christ's sacrifice. They will know him personally and experience him powerfully, unlike most people in Old Testament times.
