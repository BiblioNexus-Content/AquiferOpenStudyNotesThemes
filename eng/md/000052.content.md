## Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility (id: 500315)

The Bible shows that everything is under God's control. In other words, God is sovereign over everything. For example, rain falls on both good and bad people as part of God's plan ([Matthew 5:45](https://ref.ly/Matt5:45)).

God is not responsible for our sins. They come from our own desires so we are responsible for them. Scripture shows that people can choose to follow God or reject him (see, for example, [Deuteronomy 30:1–20](https://ref.ly/Deut30:15-Deut30:20); [Joshua 24:15](https://ref.ly/Josh24:15); [John 1:12](https://ref.ly/John1:12); [Romans 10:9–13](https://ref.ly/Rom10:9-Rom10:13)). God does not force people to have faith in him.

[Ezekiel 14:9–11](https://ref.ly/Ezek14:9-Ezek14:11) describes an interesting situation where God deceives a prophet but still holds the prophet responsible for his actions. This raises a challenging question: How do we explain how God is in control of everything but humans make personal choices for which we are accountable?

When God allowed false prophets to tell untrue messages, he gave them and their listeners what they wanted (see [2 Thessalonians 2:11](https://ref.ly/2Thess2:11)). Even a false prophet could only mislead people with the Lord’s permission or guidance. Without God's restraint, they would choose lies over truth and worship "the creature rather than the Creator" (see [Romans 1:18–25](https://ref.ly/Rom1:18-Rom1:25)). God allowed them to follow their sinful desires.

The amazing thing is not that God lets some sinners stay in their false beliefs. But it is amazing that he saves sinners. He changes their desires so they want to do good for his glory (see [Ezekiel 36:25–26](https://ref.ly/Ezek36:25-Ezek36:26); [Romans 8:1–11](https://ref.ly/Rom8:1-Rom8:11); [Ephesians 2:10](https://ref.ly/Eph2:10)). We cannot fully understand this difficult issue. Yet, we can be sure of God's freely given grace. We can have hope in the new life he offers through his Holy Spirit to all who trust in him.
