## God as Holy Warrior (id: 500237)

The Arabic term *jihad,* now familiar in English, refers to a "holy war" where men fight for God. Yet, the Bible describes a "holy war" differently. In the Bible, a holy war is a conflict where God fights for his people as they trust in him. In these wars, victory relies on obedience to God, not on weapons.

During a war, King Jehoshaphat of Judah declared a fast and prayed to God with a lament ([2 Chronicles 20:3,](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:3) [5–12](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:5-2Chr20:12)). This prayer included calling on God, complaining, confessing trust, and requesting. 

Jehoshaphat and the people showed their humility by bowing with their faces to the ground ([2 Chronicles 20:18](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:18)). It is surprising to see an army led by a choir praising God as they march into battle ([20:21](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:21)). Usually battlefields are not for worship and praise. Yet, worship helps people understand God's will and invites him to save his people. God rewards trust in him. In Jehoshaphat’s case, God defeated a large enemy alliance without Israel needing to fight at all ([20:22–24](https://ref.ly/2Chr20:22-2Chr20:24)).

The New Testament shows Jesus as the conqueror of all forces against God's kingdom (see [Ephesians 1:19–21](https://ref.ly/Eph1:19-Eph1:21)). In the end, Jesus will defeat all enemies ([1 Corinthians 15:24–28](https://ref.ly/1Cor15:24-1Cor15:28); [Revelation 19:11–20:15](https://ref.ly/Rev19:11-Rev20:15)). This victory will make God's rule and worship complete: “Hallelujah! For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns” ([Revelation 19:6](https://ref.ly/Rev19:6)).
