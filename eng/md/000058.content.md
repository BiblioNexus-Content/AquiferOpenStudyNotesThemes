## Enjoying God’s Gifts (id: 500287)

The Teacher (the main speaker) in Ecclesiastes often concludes that we should enjoy life because it is a gift from God (see [Ecclesiastes 2:24–25](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:24-Eccl2:25); [3:12–13](https://ref.ly/Eccl3:12-Eccl3:13), [22](https://ref.ly/Eccl3:22); [5:18](https://ref.ly/Eccl5:18); [6:9](https://ref.ly/Eccl6:9); [8:15](https://ref.ly/Eccl8:15); [9:7–9](https://ref.ly/Eccl9:7-Eccl9:9); [11:7–10](https://ref.ly/Eccl11:7-Eccl11:10)). Even when life seems difficult, it is meant for laughter, dancing, love, and peace. Life is especially valuable when old age and death threaten joy ([9:4](https://ref.ly/Eccl9:4), [10](https://ref.ly/Eccl9:10); [11:7–9](https://ref.ly/Eccl11:7-Eccl11:9); [12:1](https://ref.ly/Eccl12:1)). We should enjoy our food, drink, health, clothes, loving spouse, children, daily work, and times of rest. 

Some people might be surprised to find such joy in Ecclesiastes since this book also talks about sad and frustrating things in life. But this mix of joy and sorrow shows wisdom. A wise person understands life deeply and sees how to live well even in an imperfect world.

When we focus too much on seeking pleasure, we actually make ourselves less happy. The Teacher warns that seeking pleasure alone is unwise and unprofitable ([2:1–2](https://ref.ly/Eccl2:1-Eccl2:2); [7:4](https://ref.ly/Eccl7:4); [10:16–19](https://ref.ly/Eccl10:16-Eccl10:19); see also [Isaiah 22:13](https://ref.ly/Isa22:13); [56:12](https://ref.ly/Isa56:12); [Luke 12:19–20](https://ref.ly/Luke12:19-Luke12:20)). The New Testament encourages us to find joy in everything, even during distress and challenges ([Philippians 4:4](https://ref.ly/Phil4:4); [James 1:2](https://ref.ly/Jas1:2)). One tradition in Christianity says that “the chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy him forever” (*Westminster Shorter Catechism,* Question 1\).
