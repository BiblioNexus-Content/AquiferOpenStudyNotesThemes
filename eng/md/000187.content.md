## Spirit Empowerment (id: 500187)

Throughout the Bible, when needed, God gives special abilities to those committed to serving him. The story of Moses and the seventy elders is an early example. It shows that God has acted in special ways among his people throughout history. When Moses had no more patience for rebellious Israel, God instructed him to choose seventy men to assist him ([Numbers 11:1–15](https://ref.ly/Num11:1-Num11:15), [16–17](https://ref.ly/Num11:16-Num11:17); see also [Exodus 18:14–26](https://ref.ly/Exod18:14-Exod18:26)). Then, God shared the Holy Spirit that Moses had with these men, empowering them for service ([Numbers 11:24–25](https://ref.ly/Num11:24-Num11:25)).

God's Spirit\-empowered Joshua to succeed Moses ([Numbers 27:18](https://ref.ly/Num27:18); see also [Deuteronomy 34:9](https://ref.ly/Deut34:9)). During the time of the judges, the Spirit of God helped Israel's leaders. This included: 

* Othniel ([Judges 3:10](https://ref.ly/Judg3:10));
* Gideon ([Judges 6:34](https://ref.ly/Judg6:34));
* Jephthah ([Judges 11:29](https://ref.ly/Judg11:29)); and
* Samson ([Judges 13:25](https://ref.ly/Judg13:25); [14:6](https://ref.ly/Judg14:6), [19](https://ref.ly/Judg14:19); [15:14](https://ref.ly/Judg15:14)).

King David drew strength from God's presence. His understanding of God's actions in history and his life made him a great leader (for example, [1 Samuel 16:13](https://ref.ly/1Sam16:13); [17:45](https://ref.ly/1Sam17:45); [18:12](https://ref.ly/1Sam18:12), [28](https://ref.ly/1Sam18:28)). The prophets knew their special work was possible because of the Spirit's presence and power (for example, [Isaiah 61:1](https://ref.ly/Isa61:1); [Ezekiel 11:5](https://ref.ly/Ezek11:5); [Zechariah 4:6](https://ref.ly/Zech4:6)).

God's Spirit anointed Jesus and empowered for a special mission (see [Matthew 12:18](https://ref.ly/Matt12:18); [Luke 4:1](https://ref.ly/Luke4:1), [14](https://ref.ly/Luke4:14), [18](https://ref.ly/Luke4:18); [John 3:34](https://ref.ly/John3:34); [Acts 10:38](https://ref.ly/Acts10:38)). He spoke about the Spirit's important role in the church ([Acts 1:8](https://ref.ly/Acts1:8)). The Spirit's arrival allowed the gathered Christians to speak with power on the day of Pentecost ([Acts 2:4–5](https://ref.ly/Acts2:4-Acts2:5), [16–18](https://ref.ly/Acts2:16-Acts2:18); compare [Joel 2:28–29](https://ref.ly/Joel2:28-Joel2:29)). 

After Pentecost, the Spirit gave the church courage and strength ([Acts 4:31](https://ref.ly/Acts4:31); [19:6](https://ref.ly/Acts19:6); [20:28](https://ref.ly/Acts20:28); [1 Corinthians 12:1–31](https://ref.ly/1Cor12:1-1Cor12:31); [Galatians 3:2–5](https://ref.ly/Gal3:2-Gal3:5)). The Holy Spirit still remains with God's people today. The Spirit acts as needed to renew and strengthen God's people. He continues to prepare them for the tasks God calls them to do.
