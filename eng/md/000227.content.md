## The Heart in the Psalms (id: 500275)

The Hebrew words *leb* and *lebab* both mean "heart." But these words are difficult to translate. They rarely refer to the physical human heart. Instead, these terms usually refer to the center of a person's being. They represent a person's thoughts, reflections, will, and motives. The story of someone's heart shows their commitment and the direction of their life.

The psalms speak a lot about the heart. The hearts of evil people are clever and full of schemes ([Psalm 58:2](https://ref.ly/Ps58:2); [64:6](https://ref.ly/Ps64:6); [140:2](https://ref.ly/Ps140:2)). They are deceptive, hypocritical, greedy, jealous, and lack honesty ([10:3](https://ref.ly/Ps10:3); [28:3](https://ref.ly/Ps28:3); [41:6](https://ref.ly/Ps41:6); [55:21](https://ref.ly/Ps55:21); [62:4](https://ref.ly/Ps62:4); [141:4](https://ref.ly/Ps141:4)). Over time, they become more arrogant, careless, and stubborn ([14:1](https://ref.ly/Ps14:1); [17:10](https://ref.ly/Ps17:10); [73:7](https://ref.ly/Ps73:7); [78:8](https://ref.ly/Ps78:8); [81:12](https://ref.ly/Ps81:12); [95:8](https://ref.ly/Ps95:8), [10](https://ref.ly/Ps95:10); [101:5](https://ref.ly/Ps101:5); [119:70](https://ref.ly/Ps119:70)). Evil people are only loyal to themselves ([78:37](https://ref.ly/Ps78:37)). Their harmful way of life leads to their own destruction ([5:9](https://ref.ly/Ps5:9)).

Meanwhile, the writers of the psalms openly express their sorrow, trouble, suffering, and desperation ([13:2](https://ref.ly/Ps13:2); [22:14](https://ref.ly/Ps22:14); [25:17](https://ref.ly/Ps25:17); [38:8](https://ref.ly/Ps38:8), [10](https://ref.ly/Ps38:10); [40:12](https://ref.ly/Ps40:12); [55:4](https://ref.ly/Ps55:4); [61:2](https://ref.ly/Ps61:2); [69:20](https://ref.ly/Ps69:20); [73:21](https://ref.ly/Ps73:21), [26](https://ref.ly/Ps73:26); [109:22](https://ref.ly/Ps109:22); [143:4](https://ref.ly/Ps143:4); [147:3](https://ref.ly/Ps147:3)). Through their pain, their hearts grow. Their character becomes stronger, and their relationship with God deepens because of these painful experiences. They pray intensely ([62:8](https://ref.ly/Ps62:8); [119:145](https://ref.ly/Ps119:145)). They desire God ([84:2](https://ref.ly/Ps84:2)). They trust in him ([28:7](https://ref.ly/Ps28:7)). They invite God to examine their hearts or motives ([7:9](https://ref.ly/Ps7:9); [17:3](https://ref.ly/Ps17:3); [26:2](https://ref.ly/Ps26:2); [139:1–6](https://ref.ly/Ps139:1-Ps139:6), [23](https://ref.ly/Ps139:23)). Their commitment remains steady, and they have "a pure heart" ([24:4](https://ref.ly/Ps24:4); [51:10](https://ref.ly/Ps51:10); [73:1](https://ref.ly/Ps73:1), [13](https://ref.ly/Ps73:13)). They are content, even when humbled ([131:1](https://ref.ly/Ps131:1)). 

As God heals their broken hearts (their deep emotional pain, sorrow, or distress), they become strong and confident ([34:17–18](https://ref.ly/Ps34:17-Ps34:18); [51:17](https://ref.ly/Ps51:17); [27:3](https://ref.ly/Ps27:3), [14](https://ref.ly/Ps27:14); [31:24](https://ref.ly/Ps31:24); [57:7](https://ref.ly/Ps57:7); [108:1](https://ref.ly/Ps108:1); [112:7–8](https://ref.ly/Ps112:7-Ps112:8); [138:3](https://ref.ly/Ps138:3)). They are full of life ([22:26](https://ref.ly/Ps22:26); [69:32](https://ref.ly/Ps69:32)). In the end, God satisfies them and fulfills what their hearts desire ([20:4](https://ref.ly/Ps20:4); [21:2](https://ref.ly/Ps21:2); [37:4](https://ref.ly/Ps37:4)). This brings joy and praise to godly people ([4:7](https://ref.ly/Ps4:7); [9:1](https://ref.ly/Ps9:1); [13:5](https://ref.ly/Ps13:5); [16:7](https://ref.ly/Ps16:7), [9](https://ref.ly/Ps16:9); [19:8](https://ref.ly/Ps19:8); [30:11–12](https://ref.ly/Ps30:11-Ps30:12); [33:21](https://ref.ly/Ps33:21); [86:12](https://ref.ly/Ps86:12); [89:50](https://ref.ly/Ps89:50); [102:4](https://ref.ly/Ps102:4); [105:3](https://ref.ly/Ps105:3); [111:1](https://ref.ly/Ps111:1); [119:7](https://ref.ly/Ps119:7), [111](https://ref.ly/Ps119:111); [138:1](https://ref.ly/Ps138:1)).
